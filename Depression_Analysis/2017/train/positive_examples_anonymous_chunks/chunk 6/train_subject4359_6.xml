	<TEXT> Lol same here. But I suppose watching your dog eat a cake that looks like him/her would be kinda awkward.

Kudos to you op, it's an impressive cake! But I'd feel somewhat guilty eating the cake that looks like a cute puppy ;â€“; </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At first I thought the crusader's Bulwark skill was completely useless but then I realized it's pretty useful when dealing with the more powerful enemies and bosses.

The same could be said for weakening/debuffing curses. I think the occultist/vestal and the bounty hunter go well together since the latter doesn't have to spend a turn to mark/stun enemies. The curses/stun skills may end up crit'ing and provide some stress relief and the bounty hunter moves in for the kill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the idea of having monsters rise against Hamlet! I would love to have some more new initiatives in the game. Right now I have the champion level bosses waiting for me but I already know their pattern... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha I actually started a thread on Steam about a similar topic yesterday or so.

I grieve for the first Crusader and Highway Man. It's like losing someone who began the quest with you :( I have three separate games going on in the DD right now so they are still alive in some. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have yet to upgrade all the facilities (the survivalist upgrades are so expensive) so I haven't thought about that. Since more dungeons are in development maybe we'll be able to upgrade shops further with heirlooms. Hope to see more variety on that note too but it is probably unnecessary. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> An idea for improving the trinket system </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-26 07:40:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a bit new to the DD subreddit so this might have been discussed earlier but here's my suggestion:

1) Option to sell trinkets

I think this one is a no brainer. I see a lot of people asking for this option on Steam. I don't even want a great payout either. I wish I could get at least SOME money back for trinkets that I never use. 

2) Combiner / Gamble

Something I mentioned in my comment in the Steam community.

Similar to the Horadric Cube in Diablo II or the rune combiner in the League. The player is allowed access to a combiner after completing a veteran level quest (or champion, if the developers see fit). Chuck 2-3 trinkets into it and generate either (a) a trinket that combines some of the properties of the input or (b) a totally random trinket. This way completing previous quests again would have a new perk: get old trinkets that you can gamble with.

I think I can deal with occasionally shitty RNG. I just wish there were more ways to salvage trinkets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally. I mean it hasn't come up that often for me fortunately (60+ week) but when it does I hate walking back and forth. I like taking 20 food for medium missions and maps like this make me waste food. I want to save some for extra stress relief goddamn it :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like the Jester and would love to feature him more in my quests but his spot is usually filled by the Plague Doctor or the Grave Robber. Your build seems a bit risky for my taste (no tank!) but I'll give it a shot. I didn't realize Solo could be a good opening. I usually have him do early Harvest or Slice Off to inflict bleed damage. </TEXT>
