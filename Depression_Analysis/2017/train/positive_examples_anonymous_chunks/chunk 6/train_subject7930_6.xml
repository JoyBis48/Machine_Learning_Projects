	<TEXT> Right after sex. I hadn't even gotten dressed yet and we'd spent the whole weekend together after several months of long-distance. I found out after it was because he'd started seeing some other girl at his college without telling me about a month before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not anti-weed. I'm all for legalization, but I don't believe weed really lives up to the pedestal that people usually put it on. I hung around with some people who were avid tree-lovers in high school, but I never really got much enjoyment out of it.

I honestly think there are some types of people that would do better without it. Of course, I'm all fine with medical use and those who are capable of using it to enhance rather than hurt their lifestyle. 

What I definitely find weird is this strange sort of entitlement that comes with those who get really obsessive about it to the point that they feel superior to those that choose not to partake. People who will end up relying on smoking as a form of validation for their life should not go near it. It got very sad to see my friends have to resort to smoking every couple of hours because apparently not being high was just that bad. </TEXT>
