	<TEXT> Good luck with that. As I mentioned, it's hard for me to do these "imaginary" things. But my therapist gave me a hint. She wants me to be aware of the "should," "have," "must," "always," "never," etc. That's easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, keeping at it. Thanks for the support. :) Apart from antidepressants/antianxiety meds, I'm on mood stabilizers and low doses of antipsychotics. Just reading what I wrote seems a little too much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it does make sense. I have had feedback, especially from my boyfriend about the same. But to get one level up above the subconscious and to have a voice tell "You are wrong, I'm not a bad person. Stop criticizing me so much!" is a little too much for me at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My therapist asked me to try and be an imaginary observer about how critical I'm about myself. She thinks that even if you can't stop being hyper-self-critical, being aware of it helps.
