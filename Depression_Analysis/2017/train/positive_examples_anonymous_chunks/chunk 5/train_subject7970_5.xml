I don't think he's getting burnt out or bored, he seems to still enjoy the game. It's just loss of focus after recording multiple episodes in a row.

After 1.5 hours of standing still in a train in the middle of nowhere, the damn train turned around and I had to travel along by bus. I got in 2 hours late on my first day.. Tuesday was fine. Wednesday I've spent the day at home in bed being sick. Thursday I felt better so I went back there, they told me to go back home to get better. And today I spent my time at home too, trying to get better. I still feel rubbish and I called off for work in the weekend. Bye money.. :P Hope I'm no longer tired and cold on Monday so I can get a new fresh start! </TEXT>
