	<TEXT> I use the Carrot apps. For anyone who's played Portal, it's like GLADoS but for being fit. It's awesome. Also, with the Health app (on iPhones, I don't know if Android has an equivalent), if I record a workout on the Carrot workout app, or with one of my other workout apps (NikeRun, Fitnet, etc), it automatically puts the calories burned into my Carrot calorie counting app. Makes life a lot simpler.

What do you guys use and why do you like it? </TEXT>

No real help here, just letting you know you're not the only one. I will have to return to working out a bit slowly, as the flu took a lot out of me and I think I'll be weak and vulnerable for about another week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the best chicken ramen noodle recipe ever. It sounds so gross but it's incredible.

Make the noodles, strain out most of the water. Then stir in about half of the seasoning packet and toss it with a bunch of lemon pepper. Set it aside.

Cook a can of cream of chicken soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles to your preferred level of soupiness.

Enjoy.

The whole thing costs like a dollar, and takes 15 minutes tops. And it's so delicious. </TEXT>
