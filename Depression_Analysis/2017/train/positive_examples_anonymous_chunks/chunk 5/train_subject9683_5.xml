	<TEXT> I'm not a huge IMDb user, but in Episode 21's cast.... literally nobody dies. Is this confirmed? or just put on IMDb and will be changed once it airs or once episode 20 finishes.

	<TEXT> I like that theory, this show is about the origins and the journeys of many heroes/villains, (e.g. Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Black Canary, Deadshot, still kind wish they had Sara league of assassins flash backs to show her time away from Starling, but maybe that will be a spin off series.) If Deathstroke got his suit, and Green Arrow got his beard at the end of the 5 years, then I don't see why we can't see [this Deadshot](http://i.imgur.com/wFN7pMK.png) plus it's a metal suit, maybe (just my theory) Ray Palmer invents a fire resistance flak jacket for him, and he joins Team Arrow for a couple episode, but ultimately returns to his villainy. </TEXT>
