	<TEXT> The part of Inception that I found to be deep was Dom and Mal, with the whole token thing. It's possible that during the entire movie Dom was asleep and Mal kept infiltrating in an attempt to wake him up, but he perceived her to be a threat to his missions instead.  There's also theories about each of the characters being alts in Dom's dreams, which are always against Mal's invasions.

Unless I'm just 100% incorrect, which I may be.  I formed this hypothesis while under the influence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to disagree with everyone here about the calories.

If your doctor suggested that low, I say go for it.  Plenty of morbidly obese people jump start their weight loss with doctor-supervised diets with crazy low calories.  That's just what your diet is, doctor supervised.  Your doctor isn't an idiot, he is highly educated in metabolic disorders and he suggested it for a reason.  Whether it be because your BMR is lower due to PCOS (see below) or as a means to reduce your stomach size and make you fuller faster, I would personally take his advice.

[Also, there have been studies performed on PCOS's effect on BMR, and it has been shown that women with PCOS and insulin resistance have a BMR lower than the average non PCOS/IR woman by as much as 700 calories.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18678372)  So if an average woman burns 1800 calories/day at your weight, you may actually only burn 1100 calories/day.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely agree with you.  I'm a Christian and the whole point about being a Christian is that we are absolutely imperfect and sinners.  Yes, we as Christians should strive to be more like Jesus, but it's impossible to not be sinners.  Honestly, if I was called out by someone who didn't share my faith I would be a little peeved, because the person calling me out doesn't share the same perspective I do.  Call me out on just being a bad human being if I am, don't bring my faith into it unless you're another Christian who I also consider a good friend trying to keep me accountable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, my husband did.  We were juniors in college and had known each other since 7th grade.  We dated for 6 months in 9th grade until I dumped him, but we stayed best friends.  During college I would hang out with him when we were both home and we would usually end up making out most of the time.  I had made up my mind, though, that I wouldn't date him or be with him and let him know.

During the fall semester, I saw on facebook that he had entered a relationship with a girl I knew he was only with because he was lonely.  I realized how much I cared for him when I saw that post.  It was like a punch to the gut.  So I called him up and professed my love for him, knowing he loved me back.

He called his gf that night and dumped her and we started dating immediately.  We didn't make it social media official for a few months so that we wouldn't hurt the other girl's feelings by immediately bragging.  

Got married a couple years later and now have a 7 week old son together.  I don't regret it at all.  I am sorry I went about it the way I did, by hurting another girl.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good luck!  My tip: eat as much as you want at the beginning.  You may either be ravenous and want to eat as much as you did before, or you may get really full really quickly due to the high fat content.  Don't worry about calories these first couple of weeks, just work on getting keto adapted.  Once you're keto adapted your body will probably start talking to you more clearly and let you know when you are truly full.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-21 03:50:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had my little man, Rhys Adam, on Wednesday, 10/15, at 37+3.  

On 9/15 I had an appointment with my OB and my BP was 140/90.  I was sent to L D triage for monitoring and it was determined I just had a little gestational hypertension (no pre-e!).  So my doctor put me on modified bed rest and I was officially starting my maternity leave.

At my 36 week appointment, my doctor did a cervical check and said my cervix was thin but not dilated.  Two days previous I had lost my mucous plug, but I knew not to hold my breath.  At my 37 week appointment it was the same thing, thin cervix, still pretty high.

Tuesday I got what I now assume was the nesting bug.  I didn't furiously clean, I just straightened up, finished washing all the clothes, ran a couple of errands, but still stayed mostly seated/relaxed.  I hadn't been doing anything to get labor started.  No dates, no pineapple, no castor oil, nothing.  I decided it had been too long since getting busy with the husband so we got down to business.  I couldn't sleep, so I stayed up watching Netflix.  At about 1am I decided it was time to crawl into bed.  I lift one leg onto the bed and feel a trickle that was definitely NOT urine.  So I tell my husband, stand around for a little, and there was another small gush.  We pack up and head to the hospital because I didn't want to wait around with broken water.

We get to the hospital and I have to check in at the ER before they take me to L D triage.  As I was sitting filling out the check in form... GUSH.  Water broken, no doubt about it.  We get to L D triage and it's confirmed.  L D was pretty busy around that time so we hung out for a few hours until they got a room prepared for us.  We arrived at L D triage at 1:40am and got put in a room around 3:30am.  I wasn't having any contractions so they started pitocin.  My mom and MIL arrived at 5:40am.

Around 7am the contractions really started and I was dilated up to 3cm.  I asked for something for the pain and they gave me Stadol and Zofran. As the contractions ramped up, I realized the stadol was doing nothing for me.  I was squeezing DH's hand, and everything was incredibly annoying during the contractions.  They must have been about a minute apart.

At 8:30am I couldn't take any more.  I was at 4cm and I got my epidural.  Sweet relief.  The next 8 hours or so I just continued dilating, watching HGTV, and chatting with my family.  Around 4:30pm I noticed I was getting the shivers but I assumed it was from the epidural.  At 5pm it was confirmed I was at 10cm and it was time to start pushing, but I had started running a fever.  My nurse told me if i gets above 99.5 then I would have something called Chorioamnionitis.  Basically since my water had been broken so long and I'd had a few cervical checks, I started getting an infection.  Not much later my fever bypassed that.  They started me on some antibiotics while I started pushing.

Doctor checked me at 10cm and made a comment about how narrow my pelvis was, commenting about my pubic bone and the position.  He said we'll probably have to do a c-section but we can start pushing.

Pushing wasn't too bad honestly. I had great coaches in my husband and the awesome L D nurse I had. I just felt like a softball was passing painlessly through my vagina.  At 6pm the doctor came back in with the delivery team and everyone started preparing for little man's arrival.  At 6:17pm he was born.  6lb 11.5oz, 19.75 inches.  He had a fever from the chorio, but otherwise he was perfect.  

I had an episiotomy and 2nd degree tear.  I'm so in love with this little guy that everything I went through was so worth it.

Because of the chorio, he had to stay 48 hours in the NICU.  His blood cultures were monitored and once both of us were pumped full of antibiotics and determined to be infection free, we got to go home Friday night!  His bilirubin levels were a little high so we had to go back in for a test on Saturday morning.  He barely passed, but we decided to do 24 hours of phototherapy anyways because he wasn't eating as much as he needed to in order to get rid of the jaundice.

He came home for good yesterday morning at 10am and it's been wonderful ever since!

	<TEXT> If it gets to the point where it's interfering with your day to day life, you need to tell your doctor about it (whether it be your GP or OB).  Occasional anxiety is normal, but when it's every day and gets in the way of your life, it needs more attention.  Some medications are safe during pregnancy and breast feeding and your mental health is of utmost importance right now and after you deliver baby. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.  I had a history of anxiety and depression beforehand, and I weaned off my meds in month 2.  Month 6 rolls around and BAM, anxiety is back worse than ever.  I'm now on low dose Prozac to help.

But anxiety during pregnancy is common, even for those people who haven't experienced it before.  Just take deep breaths and breathe for as long as it takes to pass.  Don't take your pulse during this time, it just causes a negative feedback loop.  That is, you feel your pulse, you feel it's fast, and you panic because it's fast, causing it to go faster.

I have to take my BP twice daily due to gestational hypertension, and honestly my pulse is anywhere between 90 and 115.  Doctor said this is fine, as your heart rate during pregnancy is going to increase due to more blood in your body.

Just deep breaths, everything will be fine.  If you do realize something is triggering them, just tell yourself "panicking will do nothing to help the situation."  Stay away from Dr. Google. </TEXT>
