That's like saying intelligent people shouldn't have a bias towards them because a small group of them ended up head of a despotic dictatorship. 

The common thread I'm finding here is that you believe bias towards height is unearned and based in genetic phantoms from our African savanna past and that it should be irrelevant.

	<TEXT> The point is to get people to question what they've been told, why they believe etc. Most people end up believing the religion they grew up in, without truly thinking about what it means. 

And then there are the people who use religion to justify murder, and fuck what those people think. If they want to be irrational asshats, fine, but don't expect me to give any consideration to their feelings. 

What happens when people don't think about what the believe, they become dogmatic and hardliners in getting others to believe, follow, and respect. Extremism begins when you don't allow others to question your beliefs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pay attention to the words I am using, not the context you think is there. Think of this as monotone as you can make it.

the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans.
The company gets a $450 dollar tax credit a year if they spend 1,800 a year paying down an employees debt

The company spends more on paying down student loans, than they would receive in tax credit, which (again) would not encourage hiring of new college grads. This requires businesses to spend more than they receive, which they are not inclined to do.

I think that as a means to an end, it's a bit too complex and likely ineffective. 

Just because it's AN answer doesn't make it the BEST answer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're forgetting how much it costs to live. A loaf of bread costs the same for everyone, but it is a larger portion of total income to a poor person. 

There's basically a minimum cost of living if you have a place to live and that cost doesn't necessarily increase the more money you make. If you take 5% of someone making 20k versus 100k, the person making 20k has to make harder choices to cut, as opposed to the 100k person. 

The 100k person can still invest, afford property, play and not have to worry about paying the electric, or rent. the 20k person has much less room to save money, which means they can't take the actions that would allow them to increase their wealth like buying property, investing in retirement or the stock market. 

The point isn't that the person making 2mil doesn't deserve it, the point is that we operate more successfully if more people have the opportunity to make 2 mil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not familiar with individual tribes and you should get in touch with the tribal council, they deal with these things on a regular basis. 

However, it would really depend on the tribal hospital having a birth record of the grandmother being born to a native. As in on the birth certificate being born to 'this person' who is a tribe member. 

Then the father has to have his birth certificate updated, and then her birth certificate. Its a pain in the ass, and it will take a while, but it can be worth it. 

I'm getting health insurance for $0 co-pay $0 deductible because I have my certificate of native blood. </TEXT>

Christ. Seriously, respect people's wishes. If someone does not want to be kept alive on a machine past a certain point, let them go. 

Also, get a medical directive set up. You could be in a shitty crash today and be in just pain for the rest of your life unless you tell your family.  </TEXT>

"Winning Militarily" huh?

The opponent was maybe out-numbered, seriously outgunned and still gaining ground on a strategic level. 

On a just war, no politics level, they were handing us our ass in a war of attrition. </TEXT>
