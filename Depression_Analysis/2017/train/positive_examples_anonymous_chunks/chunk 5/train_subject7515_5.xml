	<TEXT> I am. Tacos are like open ended burritos made out of razor blades. Burritos are so much easier to hold on to. Except if they aren't wrapped well they get soggy by the end </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last time I saw them it was:

Rodeo Ruby Love

Streetlight Manifesto

Reel Big Fish

Lost my coat and shoes in the circle pit, found them in the sound booth, made friends with some of the techs and got pulled over at 3am in Camden because my car matched the description of a stolen vehicle. Epic concert and fun times
