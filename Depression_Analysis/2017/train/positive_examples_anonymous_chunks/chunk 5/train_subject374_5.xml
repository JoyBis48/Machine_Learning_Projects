	<TEXT> Hey - don't stop doing what you're doing. 
I personally don't think we have a valid excuse to be rude to guys who approach us simply because we're "not in the mood" or we're already taken. If you genuinely just want to say hi and start a friendly conversation, there shouldn't be anything wrong with that!

If you're being sleazy/creepy and all up in our personal space too soon and getting touchy/feely - our body language will tell you we're uncomfortable then yeah, chances are you're going to end up getting rejected. Outside of these kind of scenarios - a rude bullshit snappy "not interested" is pretty stink. Turn right around and walk away - you just dodged a bullet.

	<TEXT> Exactly! And then if the answer is no you can move on. What have you got to lose? Good luck and let us know how it went!!

In my opinion, when my texts start getting a bit sparse and short i'm actually just politely answering your texts but I'm also losing or feigning interest - I need to stop doing that and just be up front.  </TEXT>
