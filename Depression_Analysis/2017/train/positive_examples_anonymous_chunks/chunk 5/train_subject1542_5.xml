	<TEXT> currently in deconversion. took a pretty big step and told my church that id be leaving. not sure if i should be completely honest and explain why. 

edit
it wasn't exactly a ceremonial or crazy process to deconvert, it was actually after i had smoked and was being completely honest with myself that i admitted, wow i don't even believe anymore. 

i actually gave a eulogy when my friend died in 2010. i remember convincing myself and saying, wow god wanted him so bad, he's in a better place now, but looking back i realize and admit that i didn't and don't think he went anywhere. his consciousness left his body, and my friend is dead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah i learned about that a little bit in my buddhism class. he never really claimed to be a deity, but was it his original teaching that buddhists would be reincarnated? or that there is an afterlife? or was that based on something else </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is one of the questions that still bothers me. Who was Jesus if christianity isn't real? I guess this goes for Muhammad and Buddha too. Did these guys all just convince themselves they were actual deities? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> definitely think about it. one of my best friends died couple years ago and i gave his eulogy before my deconversion. i said the basic christian comforting lines and i also said it so i would feel better too. but now that i think about it, i have to admit to myself that he's just dead and gone. its painful but thats what ihave to rationalize. when my mom had cancer, i was tempted to pray, even though my brain knows that there probably isnt anyone listening </TEXT>
