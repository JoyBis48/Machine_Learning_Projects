	<TEXT> no problem! its been about 24 hours since i smoked and ive just been sleeping and lying in bed all day. I asked the guy i smoked with how he was doing and he said it was amazing for him. He smokes a ton everyday so i feel i cant really compare myself to him. It might be fair to mention that i took my anti-anxiety/depression pill right after i smoked because i have to take it at night. i take lexapro, just info if anyone knows if this contributes </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thanks! you might has misunderstood as i have smoked alot before. i started in january and really usually just sit on the computer or talk to my friends when i'm high. I never really know what strain i'm smoking because where i live it doesnt really matter. that's what concerns me the most, is WHAT i was smoking seeing as it wasnt like the other times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so im a fairly new smoker and have never really gotten to high when i smoked with friends. Last night i smoked out of a gravity bong with some guys and then went home with my 2 best friends. almost immediately i knew something was weird throughout the night i would start sobbing uncontrollably, shaking and being unresponsive to my friends. they said everything i said made absolutely no sense at all. When i woke up this morning i remembered very little from last night. can anyone explain to me what happened? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here's the story, my best friend and i are both quirky strange people who are really affectionate to eachother. we hold hands in the hallway and hug; though we both know that its purely platonic. We're both girls. One night while she was staying the night we were both really horny and decided to make out. After we were done we both laughed it off and said it sucked, and everything was back to normal with us. We're both straight. BUT someone found out and told everyone that we made out, everyone knows and i dont know what to do about it. I'm more embarassed than upset but i dont want to be labeled "that girl" any advice on what to do?

TLDR: i made out with my best friend of the same gender. there are no awkward feelings towards eachother. everyone knows now. what do we do now? </TEXT>
