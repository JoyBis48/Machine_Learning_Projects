	<TEXT> Income equality doesn't mean both the CEO and the cashiers make the same amount. It means their income goes up the same amount.

If the CEO sees a 5% increase in pay, so should the cashiers. If only people at the top see their incomes go up, the people at the bottom have to make do with less and less. More money ends up in the hands of the richest people. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A thought exercise: How would SRS react to a proposed law that would put women on a level playing field with men when it came to unwanted children? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-18 03:48:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We all know SRS's feelings about a "financial abortion" option for men. Their argument is that women are just exercising their rights over their bodies, but men are abandoning their children.

Okay, let's say that someday artificial uteruses become possible. Fetuses can be easily transplanted from a real uterus to an artificial one in a lab. Let's say abortion is still contested in many places and personhood amendments are still being pushed. 

As a compromise it's suggested that abortion be made illegal, but transplanting fetuses into an artificial womb is made free and is easily attained. Even publicly funded. Pro-life people get their way (no more murdering babies, as they see it) and women still have complete control over their bodies.

Now, once the fetus becomes full term three things can happen. One: Both parents sign it out and assume responsibility. Two: Both consent to adopting it out. Three: One parent signs it out, and if the other doesn't want to, they're ordered to pay child support to the parent who takes custody.

This makes it possible that both men and women might end up being financially responsible for a child they didn't want and never had any way to escape paying for it for 18+ years once conception happened. 

Now, the fun part: What's SRS's reaction to this proposed law?

"OMG, men are always wanting women to assume the role as mothers no matter what else she wants to do with her life!"

"I know, now women might end up not reaching their full potential as members of society because they have the responsibility of paying for a child they didn't consent to."

"Doesn't anyone in this patriarchy care that some women who were raped might end up paying child support to her rapist?" (The way SRS currently doesn't care if this happens to men)

"Of course, now we're back to parenthood by chance, not by choice. We're always taking choices away from women."

"What if a man intentionally gets a woman pregnant so she has no option but to pay him to support a child he wants but she doesn't? Does the woman have no recourse?"

For the record, I'd be against such a law. I don't think anyone should be made to be a parent if they don't want. But we all know what SRS would do. Have fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Jane_Doe

The St. Louis Jane Doe is an unidentified girl who was found murdered on February 28, 1983 in St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri. She has also been nicknamed "Hope" and the "Little Jane Doe."[1] The victim was estimated to be between eight and eleven when she was murdered, presumably by strangulation. The victim had also been decapitated and raped; the brutality of the crime has led to national attention.

Reading about how [Vernon Brown](http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/brown967.htm) killed his victims, I believe it's very possible she was one of his victims.

This case has always got to me because I always have a hard time understanding how a child goes without being identified. To think she might not have had family looking for her.

Here is a video that shows the only photo I know of of the body. It isn't graphic, it's only a photo of her hands tied behind her, but  knowing the context makes it 100X worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you aware that men get paid more than women?

On average. Not for the same job.

Are you aware that the work women do is consistently devalued not just on the individual level but on a massive scale that sees industries start to pay less and less as women take more and more jobs in them? 

Citation needed.

Are you aware that computer programming as an industry gained not just prestige but MASSIVE wage increases when men began to move in and take the jobs that were previously held by women?

Citation needed.

Are you aware that there’s a huge wealth gap between men and women?

23 cents on average. And not for the same job.

Are you aware of the pink tax,  whereby products intended for women consistently cost more than products intended for men despite costing the same to produce and despite women as a class having far less money than men as a class?

Products for women tend to have more going on and cost more to make. But we all know women are so brainwashed and helpless they can't just buy the men's products, right?

re you aware that women are socially sanctioned for not owning a wider selection of clothes than men, and that women’s clothes are more expensive? 

Have you ever seen what a man's suit costs? Also, thrift shops have a lot of clothes for women and not much for men. My wardrobe cost a lot less than my boyfriend's.

Are you aware that women are socially sanctioned for not wearing makeup, something else that costs a lot of money, or shaving much larger parts of their bodies than men, which causes us to go through our (more expensive) razors/razor blades faster than men?

I have never worn make-up and I have never heard anything about it. Also, I know of no job that isn't sex related that requires women to shave. Jobs that require men to shave? Quite a few.

Are you aware that women’s hygeine products are more expensive and that we’re socially sanctioned for not having long hair, something that requires, again, specific and frequently expensive products to upkeep? 

I know of no job that requires women to have long hair. However, many jobs require men to have short hair. My boyfriend had to cut his long, beautiful hair because of this. Also, many hygiene products are unisex if you think women's are that expensive.

Are you aware that these social sanctions don’t end with social ramifications, but can actually make the difference between a woman getting hired, fired, or getting a pay rise, because women who don’t perform femininity in socially accepted ways are considered less “professional”?

Citation needed.

Are you aware that in order to have sex without ending up solely responsible for a child, women who are capable of pregnancy pay huge amounts of money for birth control and/or abortions, which aren’t covered under many insurance policies while the pills cis men need to get erections is covered much more often?

Because court mandated child support no real! A woman will always end up solely responsible! Also, aren't birth control pills required to be covered now as part of Obamacare? As for expensive abortions, that really is an issue. 

Are you aware that a man is more likely to be hired if potential employers know he has children, but that a woman is less likely to be hired if potential employers know she has children?

Which is why employers can't legally ask this question.

Are you aware that women have much less available money because we start off being paid less by our jobs and we’re expected to pay more as the rent for existing in the world as a woman?

See above refutations. 

Are you aware that despite all this, not all feminists expect men to pay for our meals on a date? Are you aware that not every feminist is even interested in dating men? Are you aware that not every woman is a feminist, and the women you’re dating aren’t automatically trying to abolish gender roles just because they’re women?

Listen here why I list reasons you should pay for my food because I have no money while I insist some feminists don't want men to pay for their food (which is true).

Are you aware that you are looking at a population of people who face significantly higher rates of harrassment, abuse, and rape

Men are far more likely to be victims of assault and homicide, but when is that ever mentioned among these people? They only mention it when women are more likely to have something bad happen.

a population who is paid less and expected to pay more, a population who is tightly restricted by gender roles that expect us to do unpaid emotional and domestic labour for men like you who see it as your due

Because men don't do housework ever.

and your first fucking question is why our very top priority isn’t making sure you don’t have to pay a little extra on a goddamned date?

"Pay for my food, damn it! I'm oppressed!"

	<TEXT> The last thing I want is to tell people in dangerous jobs its okay to get high at any time if their job is dangerous, at home or at work

How is their being high at home dangerous at all no matter what their job is? They aren't doing their job from home. As long as they don't go into work under the influence, I don't care. 

If you come to a dangerous job hungover, they usually send you packing. Same should go for weed, legal or not.

But you aren't fired Monday because of a can of beer you had Friday after work. You shouldn't be fired Monday because you had a joint Friday night. That's none of your boss's business.

If you come to work hungover on anything, you should be fired. But just because you partake when you're off work doesn't mean you come in high or hungover. Hell, I got drunk last night. But I wasn't drunk or even hung over coming into work today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah and clearly we're talking about a human being capable of breathing.

But it isn't, and won't for a good long time.

Baby trees are called saplings, which very much are trees. In fact, the seed itself is what results from pollination so your analogy isn't even looking at the right stage.

Saplings aren't the same as sprouts. And my analogy is in the right stage. Seed = blastocyst that must be implanted after the sperm and egg meet. The sprout would be the fetus. Sapling would be the child.

It's a human being, period.

Citation needed.

Stop trying to belittle it so you can easily dismiss it.

Even if I thought it was a human being, I'd still be pro-choice because you can't use someone else's body against their will even as a human being.

Abortion legality has nothing to do with morality, but you've gotten so drawn in to that debate with pro-lifers that you've decided if it must be about morality then you'll just eliminate the part that brings morality into question: personhood.

Or maybe I just don't believe it's a human being? </TEXT>

*Many* people on FPH admitting to not exercising much or eating well. This wasn't some well guarded secret. In fact, it was used to make the point that portion control was most of weight loss.
