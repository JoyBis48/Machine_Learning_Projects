	<TEXT> Yeah the mom thing sounds about right :( so I'm thinking about things that don't cost money...it may sound silly but are there any support groups in your area for people with mental illnesses? Sometimes just being around people that feel similarly could help tremendously ya know  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, this is me, always. It's where the awful assumption "people aren't depressed they're just lazy" comes from. I think getting engrossed in tv or not harmful thoughts pushes away the bad thoughts. Or sometimes I can't clean my room because I physically can't get up and do it, not because I don't want to. It sucks when people don't understand. I think it's good you're recognizing it at least  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was 16. I was sitting on a plane and my mind was RACING and I was on the verge of tears, which was a common occurrence for me. I was looking around and realized this probably was not normal and everybody else on the plane wasn't going through this. I told my mom I needed help. 

I'm 20 and doing ok now :) there's just one last unhealthy behavior I'm sorting out

Thanks for asking </TEXT>
