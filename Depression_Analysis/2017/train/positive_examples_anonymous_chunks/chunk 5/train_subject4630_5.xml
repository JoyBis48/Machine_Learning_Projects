	<TEXT> So, from what I've seen, most of us seem to suffer from extreme heartbreak. I was thinking about the girl I love yesterday and thought of a lyric in pearl jam's song Black. He says "I know you're going to be a star in someone else's sky, but why, why can't it be mine"

So I started thinking... The lead singer of pearl jam had someone to lament over. I have someone to lament over. How many people have someone to lament over?

And the thing that comforted me was just the realization that this person I wanted so much ... There's thousands of them. Everyone has one, it seems. 

Suddenly she seemed less special </TEXT>
