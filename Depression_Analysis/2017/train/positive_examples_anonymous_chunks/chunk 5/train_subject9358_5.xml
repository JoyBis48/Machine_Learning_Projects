	<TEXT> Yeah I'll definitely give that a go. I definitely feel like I have a creative mind but just nowhere to release ideas onto and it's frustrating me. I just don't feel like I have a "thing" to enjoy or relax me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha sport has the opposite effect on me! I'm overweight and seriously unfit even though I've done gymnastics, ballet, dancing, yoga, cycling, running...you name it. I gained weight a few years ago and despite starving myself within an inch of my life and increasing my exercise I haven't lost any weight in two years. I'm now eating normally and doing Pilates 3 times a week on top of a job where I can't sit down and I've actually gained.

I wouldn't willingly exercise though. I find it boring. </TEXT>
