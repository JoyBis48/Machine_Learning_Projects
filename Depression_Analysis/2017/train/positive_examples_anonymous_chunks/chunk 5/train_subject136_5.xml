	<TEXT> Hey... I know it seems bad but keep pressing on. We've all been there.  Especially with the suicidal thoughts.  But why should you stop living just because of someone else?

Like I said, I KNOW it's hard. I still struggle from time to time. Allow yourself to grieve and don't feel bad about it.  Eventually you'll come out of your slump.  Also, leverage your friends and social network.  Now is the time when they're supposed to be there for you. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I [29/M] finally hit 30 days NC with my [30/F] ex after a two years of trying. Thoughts inside. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-29 04:34:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Well it’s officially been 39 days since we last had correspondence, but who’s counting right?



**HOW IT STARTED:**  After a 7 year relationship we broke up.  I tried to get back with her but she didn’t want to.  I went through emotional hell for a six months with contact between us every few days.  Then I got a girlfriend.  After that we still kept talking.  She expressed being upset that I had a girl.  I dumped my girl hoping to get back with my ex.

Bad move.  After that the NC period increased to weekly then eventually to every two weeks.  After having enough, I told her to stop texting me in July because she didn’t really care about me.  

The NC period has been increasing since then hitting a previous high of 17 days.


**HOW I FEEL NOW:**  I don’t really know how to describe how I feel.  I guess ambivalent is a good word.  I have been fortunate enough to be busy recently so I didn’t notice.  After awhile after the days start piling up it becomes easier.

I wish I could say I had closure and everything was well.  But I don’t.  I have no idea what she’s doing, who’s she’s with, or even if she’s alive for that matter.  As for my own love life, I have the benefit of having numerous attractive women who want to be in my company.  I date one in particular at the moment.  But to be honest I’m scared of getting too attached because of being burned from my last relationship.  

**THOUGHTS ABOUT NC:**  I’m conflicted.  On one hand I do believe that it is in the grieving party’s best interest to cut contact ASAP but on the other hand it’s all situational.  I was with someone for 7 years, it would be impossible for me to just stop talking to her unless what she did was very foul.  But I’m also a results kinda guy, and since none of the talking resulted in us getting back togeter I’d just have rather never talked to her again.  What was the point?

Also, I will say that after 30 days nothing magical happens.  Just an FYI

**ADVICE GOING FORWARD:**  If you’re suffering, I would advise making yourself busy and moving on from you ex.  If you talk, don’t listen to what they say, watch what they do.  I made that mistake and never will again.

I asked a good friend how he moved on from his similar situation and these were his wise words:

 “How did I get over the relationship... I didn't. You're not supposed to - not if it has real history and depth and if you both had long stretches during which you truly felt an unselfish love for each other. I carry that loss with me, and I'm lucky if I make it a full day without thinking about her at least once. We dated for 7 years - that's longer than plenty of marriages. It ended for a lot of reasons, but the primary one is that there came a time when we valued the relationship more than we valued each other - what I mean is that we didn't want to lose the relationship, so we started to hide shit from each other, be dishonest about what we wanted and needed at different times... Also, life is just a bitch sometimes. Timing is a bitch. Circumstance is a bitch.”

Ironically that made me feel better.  He's living his life of course, but he kept it real.

Best of luck to others on this journey of recovery.


**tl;dr**: Was together 7 years, broken up for 2, FINALLY hit the 30 day NC period. </TEXT>

You're going to completely ruin anything you've gained from going NC if you do it.  From what you've said, it sounds like she gave you a BS reason for breaking up in the first place.

I'm telling you, if you do it you're only going to prolong your torture.  I could see if you guys were still friends but you're not even talking.  I've seen this go bad too many times.  The guys gives his ex a gift while secretly hoping it makes her happy and in the end she feels that the gift is pressure to get back with him and subsequently does something to hurt his feelings.  (whether on purpose or inadvertently)   </TEXT>

It makes no sense to own if you're not going to stay in the same spot for at least 5 years.  And I need to be flexible right now. </TEXT>

1.  Hispanic is not a race.  There are plenty of white Hispanics.
2.  Hundreds of trials may end the same way but this was the one that THE MEDIA blew up. Nobody has time to keep up with every trial.  Why are you surprised that this one got more outrage than a local case?
3.  There are plenty of protests for black on black crimes.  But once again the media doesn't cover it and posters like yourself aren't going to go look for them.  
4.  I don't know their rhyme or reason.  Honestly, these people stuck in traffic did nothing to Trayvon Martin so I agree with that. </TEXT>

If no one has it say, "Okay, I got next then."  Then you can also start asking people if they wanna play with you.

If someone has next then ask them if they have 5 people.  If they have a team ask who has next after them.  Wash. Rinse. Repeat </TEXT>

I just wanted to share my story with you.  What happens next and how you handle it will be the key part.  It can be the difference between suffering for the next few months or suffering for the next few years.

The reason that I said I wish I had never broken NC is because although it would have hurt, I would have eventually gotten over it and began the healing process much earlier.  Like I said, I'm better now but it's been two years since the breakup.  I should have moved on by now.

I wish the very best for you in the future.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm no expert but I've went through exactly what you did and while it feels good in the short term, that pain is waiting right around the corner.

Ultimately, contacting your ex doesn't lead to any answers.  Over time this will frustrate you even more.  Even if she did respond, unless it is to get back together you're still back where you started.

Breakups are probably one of the most complicated things a person will ever have to go through in life.  Things that make sense in normal situations make zero sense in a breakup.  I broke NC several times after being with someone for 7 years.  I eventually told myself that we could just be friends, but here I am 2 years later wishing that I NEVER broke NC.  Why?  Because nothing has changed.  I'm much better than I was before but I didn't get that closure I was seeking.  She never came back, even when I had that "Eureka!" moment similar to yourself. </TEXT>
