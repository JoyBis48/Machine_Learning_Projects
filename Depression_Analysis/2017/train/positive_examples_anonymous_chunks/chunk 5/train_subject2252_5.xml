	<TEXT> Tl:Dr. Alcoholic friend lectures me on doing coke once, fails to see hypocrisy in choices.

So last night, I went to hang out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while  (I transferred colleges). One of them had caught wind that I did coke within the past week, and gave me a huge lecture on how I'm not on the right path, how my life will be ruined, and all that jazz. I'm just venting a bit because I did it once (no redose, no urge to do it again) yet my friend is an alcoholic who will be drunk almost every day of the week  (they have about 20 empty handles of Fireball whiskey on display in their kitchen). One friend won't even acknowledge my presence anywhere anymore, and the third guy is cool, and knows I actually have my shit together. So yea, I hate word of mouth and the warped views of addiction people have. Yes, drugs can ruin your life. No, I don't believe you can be hooked on substances after one use.

Said friend is like "yeah, I chew, I drink, I even smoke pot on occassion, but that hard shit will ruin your life." Well, at least this friend has stopped being anti-marijuana

Edit: Removed some phrasing that made me come off worse than intended. 

2nd edit: The friend who wasn't acknowledging my presence has been a bit reserved about things lately, and I was told something else was probably on his mind. I feel like an ass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> MDMA makes it hard for me to be social because an overexcited, mildly off putting, really loud, 6'4" 240 lb. male is kind of hard for people to deal with. One time, I went out to a club to go dance. Instead, I talked to people as they were coming in by the cover charge place (because I don't have a better name for it)

When I trip, I love anime. Something about Asian artwork entices me. The last time I tripped, I finished watching the arc of Hajime No Ippo I was on, and getting caught up on season 3 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen as much use out of women personally. Most of them I know tend to just drink with their friends, and maybe a quarter of that group will smoke on occassion. I think it's like 5 or 6, at the most, that I know for a fact they have done something more recreational  (MDMA, LSD, shrooms)
    
Almost every guy I know drinks or smokes. A decent amount have done coke, shrooms, acid, what have you. I can find a guy to be a safety, or to do the substance with me, much easier than I can a woman.
    
Though I have seen more women be around prescription pills than men. </TEXT>

3. This isn't a serious question. JD and Turk have the best bromance in series, and they even show up in each other's AMAs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still work across from one. Sometimes their music seeps across, past the phone kiosk in the middle where the ladies working there have a Macbook on loud blaring Drake, past the speakers we have blaring Rush, Led Zeppelin, and other classics, and into my unfortunate ears. 

One girl I know and am friends with will claim that Bring me the Horizon is better than anything I listen to. Sure I've gone through phases of shitty music tastes, but this is worse than what I used to listen to. I will list my musical experiences in a different comment if anyone is interested, so they can see my frame of reference.

That last paragraph was intended to sound incredibly pretentious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can Thor even get drunk?

But for real; the only enhancement I have seen that would even matter is having Cap's  shield to possibly block Mjolnir's strikes. Otherwise I'm feeling all levels of a Thor stomp, simply because of the tier system alone </TEXT>
