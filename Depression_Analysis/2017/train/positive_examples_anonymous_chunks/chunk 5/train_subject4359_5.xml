	<TEXT> I remember this from a sociology prof back in my undergrad years about how these sexist lines in sitcoms (an example at that time was Everybody Loves Raymond) often go rather unnoticed because the female character's retaliation soon follows. Everyone laughs but the stereotype is still there (e.g. women belong in the kitchen / should be docile, etc.) and perpetuated. 

We weren't talking about this seriously and I didn't exactly see that type of gag as a problem, but I thought it was interesting regardless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a siamese x turkish angora mix cat. He used to be a sweet kitty with a lot of patience but as he grew older he's become increasingly manipulative. He knows the scheduled meal times but would extort mom into giving treats early by clawing sofa. I don't give in since I don't give a crap about the sofa but mom does so he keeps doing this :s

Another peculiar thing is that he doesn't ever purr except when he gets sleepy and sucks on his arm in the kneading motion. He does this only around me so I should feel blessed, I suppose! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember there was another SRD with people asking OP for the original source when he changed captions of an ad and he got really defensive. He ended the conversation by saying something along the line of "whatever, I'm going to bed and have sex. Bye, losers". So this is what it boils down to in the end? Apparently no one else on the internet is having sex besides these guys?

I get they want to just end the argument. Sometimes people just can't come to an understanding or compromise at all. But to go out with that "doesn't matter, I'm having sex" remark... He may be in his late twenties but his mindset doesn't seem mature enough to consider marriage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm enrolled in a master's program and it's costing me a lot of money each term. The least I can do is to get the degree but I have little clue in regards to what my thesis should be about. Since I'm working full time and going to school at night I'm exhausted and feel like I'm not retaining anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Complacency. My current job is pretty okay but it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. But since it pays me relatively well and is stable, I'm afraid I'll just settle for this. I'm also working abroad when I'd much rather be home so there's that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's extremely frustrating when my original comment was my attempt to explain why people may take offense at OP's choice of the title. I didn't bash him. I know it was only a joke and I said it so in my first comment.

You said you don't care, and yet you continue to reply to my comment in length. What is it that you want to accomplish? I've already explained where my understanding of the two terms came from. I grew up in Vancouver, Canada with both straight and gay friends, and learned that the term homo usually bore negative connotations. It is only natural for me to assume that the word also bears the same sentiment on the web.

Frankly I'm tired of trying to argue with a stranger on the web. You are twisting my words and taking in only what you want. I will no longer respond. Enjoy holidays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't decide which term is okay to say. It's something I learned from my gay friends, academic/casual debates, media, etc. Perhaps people around you have different opinion. If you think homo has no negative connotation, by all means, use it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha ok. No I don't think it's a bad thing and in fact I support gay marriage. Have you ever encountered gays that refer to themselves as homos? Have you even read my comment? My qualms here was the use of the term homo (NOT homosexual) and the fact that it is widely recognized to be pejorative. The expression "no homo" is often used among people who disapprove of homosexuality. If OP said something like "I'm not gay but" people here wouldn't post negative comments.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I can clearly tell OP only said it as a joke, it is my understanding that the term homo is strictly pejorative. I see men commenting on /r/ladyboners but they never say "no homo". Instead they'd say something like "I'm straight but so and so is hot".

EDIT: Apparently my view is not widely accepted. Downvote me to oblivion. </TEXT>
