	<TITLE> I'm trying to find a video of the time Cena and Punk went pop-for-pop at the end of Raw </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-26 06:22:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think they were both WWE Champion (Punk leaving with the "real" title, and Cena holding the "fake" title he won against Rey Mysterio), and they were on adjacent turnbuckles.

CM Punk raised his title, and his music played.

Cena did the same, and his music immediately interrupted Punk's.

They did this back and forth at least three times each, I think. It was a cool moment, but I can't find video of it.

Help a brotha out? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Idea for a new wiki: "Kayfabe Q A." Tell me what you guys think. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-26 05:12:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know if any of you guys get as immersed in kayfabe as I do, but I sometimes see things during a given show that make me ask "Why would this person do this, if we think in terms of kayfabe?"

For example, the fact that Triple H always covered the head of the sledgehammer with his hand when he used it as a weapon. Outside of kayfabe, it's obviously because (from what I hear) he uses a real sledgehammer 99% of the time, and he uses his hand to cushion the blow.

But it's still obvious that he does so to the viewer, so it might take away from the realism... unless you can think of a reason he would do it IN kayfabe. Like, maybe he covers the hammer itself so he can control it better, since a sledgehammer is actually pretty heavy.

Something like that. Using kayfabe to explain things that make sense in real life (where wrestling is choreographed), but don't appear to make sense in kayfabe (where wrestling is a legitimate sport).

The wiki could be set up as a Q A, where Wredditors can edit the wiki itself to either ask or answer a question like the above.

What think, r/sq? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just used brackets to show which phrase I was inquiring about-- ah, excuse me. About which phrase I was inquiring. ... damnit, that was a dependent clause. Am I even allowed to start a sentence with "..."? SO MANY QUESTIONS.

:P

Anyways, which of the two bracketed phrases is correct? I'm leaning towards the first, since I think "second most" would be using "second" as an adverb to describe the adjective "most," whereas "second-most" is an adjectival phrase that would describe the noun "subscribers."

Or, on that note, I'm thinking maybe both could be considered correct? </TEXT>

It was working fine until recently, when it suddenly starting rumbling noticeably (I have it, and my laptop, on my bed, and was sitting next to it) and making a lot of noise. I opened it up to fix any problems that a tech dummy like me could find (dust, loose parts, etc.), and didn't find much of anything wrong.

The problem is persisting, however, and I can't figure out how to solve it. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like others, I take a nap during the day after 4-6 hours of sleep at night. The only reason I really do this is because I like to stay up late AND wake up early. This is really the only way I could think to pull it off. I typically get to sleep around 1-3 AM and wake up at 6-8, then nap at around 12-1.

It doesn't feel any different than your typical 8-hour sleep cycle. I feel well rested each time I wake up, and I get to sleep pretty easily in both instances.

I've considered polyphasic sleep (because tbh, I really don't like sleeping), but I have insomnia from anxiety/depression, so I'd have to dope myself up on sleep aids multiple times a day. No, thanks. </TEXT>

Emotional pain is almost exactly the same as physical pain. When it hits you, you hurt. When you hurt, you react. That reaction is what suffering is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently, CBT is supposed to help one cope with anxiety/depression/mood disorders/etc., and learn how to live a relatively normal life despite the condition(s).

From what I've read and/or heard, its general purpose is to teach one how to live WITH the condition(s) instead of eliminating it/them.

Right now, I'm losing a battle (and losing badly) between numerous anti-depressants and my anxiety/depression. Nothing's working. The only times I don't want to sob uncontrollably and crawl into a hole and never come out are when I'm sleeping. I rarely enjoy doing anything I normally like to do, so it's all but an impossibility for me to actually motivate myself to do something I *don't* want to do.

Point is, I can't possibly fathom living with this and not feeling psychologically crippled. Living a normal life where I don't neglect my own personal hygiene, sleep 16 hours a day, and spend all my free time alone in a two-story house, brooding in the basement with all the lights off since it's the only room that doesn't have windows.

Living with something that turned me into a prisoner of my own psyche is not something I can understand. It doesn't make sense and it doesn't seem possible-- as such, I feel like trying it would be a waste of time and money.

Could someone try to convince me otherwise? </TEXT>

This is actually a really good point. I did find it odd that Bryan was acting like such a dick towards Big Show, backstage and in the ring, after it was announced that they had a match against one another.

But even if Bryan should actually be viewed as a heel, what does that make The Authority? Mega heel? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My question to you is this: why is it okay for Shawn to let his emotions get the better of him, but not Bryan?

It's not okay in the context of superkicking Bryan, but it's understandable in my opinion.

Bryan losing his cool and putting Michaels in the Yes Lock is less understandable because not only was he lashing out at the wrong person (Shawn isn't the one who's making Bryan's life a living Hell), but he essentially started the chain reaction during that moment.

1. Michaels politely and humbly asks Bryan to accept his apology, face-to-face, man-to-man

2. Bryan refuses without saying anything. We don't know if he's being a smart ass, or if he's just upset overall and not at Michaels. His lack of communication is key. Instead of just shaking his head, saying something probably would have helped. This is where the chain reaction of emotional turmoil begins.

3. Shawn Michaels lashes out verbally because he feels like Bryan is making a fool of him. No one else who cost Bryan the WWE Championship has done anything even close to apologizing, but Shawn felt like he was doing the right thing, and Bryan STILL acts rebellious when it probably wasn't called for.

4. Daniel Bryan lashes out physically, as I said (and I don't mean that sardonically), at the wrong person. Sure, Shawn said some things that maybe he didn't mean or at the very least shouldn't have said. But it appears that Michaels and Bryan are friends, or at the very least, have a close teacher/student relationship. It's not like Shawn is some random guy-- you'd think Bryan would have it in him to forgive him for everything from the superkick to the verbal tongue-lashing (which, again, was a result of Bryan's stubbornness). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  to say that he humbled himself before Bryan, is, simply put, inaccurate.

The reason I agreed with HBK saying that he was humbling himself is because he was apologizing in front of millions of fans. Apologizing basically means "I was wrong. Please forgive me." Shawn Michaels is the legend of all legends. He could have attempted to save face, and not publicly admit that he significantly screwed up, by apologizing to Bryan in private, but he chose not to.

 He basically told Bryan that he was not an "A+ player" and that he was not good enough to be in the ring with Shawn. That is not humble.

He only said that to Bryan after he had become frustrated with his attitude. You can't blame him. Sure, maybe Triple H and Stephanie have it out for him. Maybe Randy Orton isn't the rightful WWE Champion. Maybe all of those people hate Daniel Bryan and want to make his life miserable. Sure. But Shawn Michaels is not one of those people. As I said, his actions weren't out of spite or hatred. It wasn't Michaels lashing out at Bryan with the superkick as much as it was defending Triple H. Shawn would have kicked the hell out of damn near ANYONE had they done that to Triple H in front of him.

He was torn between his student and (metaphorically) his brother. That's an easy choice to make if you ask me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Analyzing the Daniel Bryan/Shawn Michaels dichotomy that resulted from the Hell in a Cell match (long read, all in kayfabe) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-04 21:11:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As I said in the title, everything below is in kayfabe, even some stuff that is part of kayfabe and real life (like Shawn Michaels' rocky relationship with the WWF in the late 90s). I'd really like it to stay that way, if you guys don't mind. Please, no responses along the lines of "Because that's what the writers came up with," etc.

Now, in my opinion, it's obvious here that amongst the four people in the title, Daniel Bryan is the face, while Triple H and Orton are clear heels, and Shawn Michaels appears to be on his way or has already turned heel.

Michaels' pseudo-heel turn is what interests me the most. Shawn Michaels and Triple H are best friends in kayfabe. They're as close as the closest of brothers. So when Shawn Michaels saw Daniel Bryan assault Triple H (perhaps having NOT seen Hunter shove Bryan halfway across the ring), he reacted on emotion and retaliated with some Sweet Chin Music.

At that point, he probably realized that the decision was not the best one he could have made, but he also realized something else that was very important-- **the match was still going on, and he promised the fans that there would be a WWE Champion by the time the match was over.**

Orton took advantage of Bryan being laid out from the superkick and pinned him immediately. Michaels knew he had to count Bryan down or else he would have had to live with himself as having lied to the fans (or being mistaken, but he probably would consider that as bad as a lie).

The next night on Raw, Michaels explained to Bryan that he superkicked him because he felt the need to defend his best friend. HBK even explained why he reacted the way he did-- during Shawn's "darkest days" (when nearly the entire locker room hated him, he had severe drug issues, and he was just, simply put, an asshole), Triple H was the only person by his side. That is **extremely significant.** That type of loyalty (that Triple H showed) is the type you repay til death. Michaels probably feels like he owes Hunter his life, so the least he could do is come to his defense when he gets the sucker-punch equivalent of a hard knee to the face.

This, in my opinion, doesn't *justify* Michaels' actions towards Bryan at the end of the match, but it makes them understandable. Shawn Michaels brought up an aspect of his past that he probably doesn't like to talk about, just so Bryan could understand why he did what he did. He apologized, and offered Bryan a handshake. He refused.

At that point, Michaels got frustrated, understandably (in my opinion). He was correct in saying that he, Daniel Bryan's trainer, a Hall-of-Famer, and possibly the greatest wrestler of all time, humbled himself on international television and asked for only a handshake in return.

Shawn even did this, which may be me looking too much into this, but I can't help it-- **he took the Lord's name in vain** when he used the phrase "For the love of God!" after his emotions had overflowed.

I've followed Shawn Michaels' career extremely closely since his return in 2002, and I don't think I've EVER heard him do that during a promo, interview, etc (on WWE television). Shawn Michaels is very religious and very *serious* about his religion-- I doubt that he would do something like that unless he was extremely passionate about what he said, and more importantly, unless he meant it to the fullest possible extent.

Bryan's response? A feigned handshake whose only purpose was to set Michaels up to be locked in an extremely painful submission hold. Again, seemed (to me) to be the equivalent of a "sucker punch." Michaels could not have seen it coming and had almost zero chance of defending himself before the hold was applied.

In my opinion, Michaels was right that Bryan was being self-righteous and not showing Michaels the respect he deserved. Shawn Michaels did NOT do what he did at Hell in a Cell out of animosity or hatred-- he had neither towards Bryan (if anything, the complete opposite). He did it because in defense of someone for whom he'd probably take a bullet without hesitation.

Daniel Bryan apparently can't/didn't understand that, or has more anger issues than we realized (which is saying a lot).

	<TEXT>  He should really put his hands on it like a grown up.

If by "it," you mean "his mother's body," you should reconsider. That would be EXTREMELY difficult for a lot of people. Two of the three people I was ever closest to (my mother and my cousin) both passed away in the last ten years. Each funeral was open-casket, but I never went in for the viewing. I couldn't bear it. I'm not even squeamish-- it just would have devastated me emotionally.

Now, that's just from a visual perspective. Imagine having to actually make physical contact with the body of a person you once loved, knowing that now it's nothing but a lifeless cadaver. Its nature and its lifelessness represents the fact that you will never, ever speak to this person or have them speak to you again. It represents their suffering, your suffering, and the suffering of anyone who will miss her.

The human body also loses body heat during death, which I'm sure you know. Touching the body of a deceased person, and feeling cold instead of warmth, would probably feel extremely eerie, since when you make physical contact with a living person, you can feel the warmth of their body. It would be spooky.

Like I said in another comment, I agree with what you're saying, but I don't think it's necessarily as black-and-white as you're implying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that what he said may have offended you (hell, it offended me a little bit, and I'm generally not like that-- maybe it's because I lost my mother at 13), but it might not just be that he's a disrespectful dick by nature. Maybe that's how they feel in the culture he's from.

A good example is the culture of some Spanish-speaking countries. They celebrate a day called Dia De Los Muertos (The Day of the Dead). They *celebrate* death. They don't look at it with the stigma and negativity that we do in America.

I'm not saying the OP is in that boat exactly, but maybe he just grew up learning that a person and the body that holds them are two completely separate entities and should be treated as such.

I guess maybe it's kind of like when someone passes away, and you don't know what to do with their belongings. You probably have to give them away or throw them out eventually, and that's not really viewed as being as bad as what OP said. But he (or she, I'm honestly not sure) might look at it the same way-- that his mother's body is merely her own property, and once she's done using it, it no longer represents her.

Know what I mean? I hope I explained that well. I just feel like, while I agree with what you say, it would help to try to think of what his thought process might be and maybe it might be a little more logical than you first thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those who don't remember/don't feel like watching, Vince McMahon put a clause in a PPV-match contract which stated that Triple H and Austin could not have any physical contact with one another until they met at No Way Out, or the instigator would be suspended for six months.

After both men went over the contract and signed it, Triple H beat the piss out of Austin, and everybody (including JR and King) was confused as hell as Triple H eventually laid out Austin with a Pedigree.

When Vince told him that he had just gotten himself suspended, Triple H revealed that he had never signed the contract (but Austin *had* signed), and thus Triple H was not legally bound by the "No contact" clause. On top of THAT, the fact that Austin had already signed meant that he could not retaliate against Triple H for the assault without being suspended.

Even Vince McMahon, the consummate evil genius himself, couldn't help but smile when he realized what Triple H had pulled off. "Cerebral Assassin" indeed.

This all led to Stephanie getting a Stunner the next week, but still. _ </TEXT>

* [Graphics card specs](http://2.imgland.net/9qTfmE.png)

As you can see, the graphics card (which, having researched, I believe is notorious for overheating) all but flame broils my motherboard. Sometimes I want to watch movies or sports games on my laptop, but I can't, because it'll overheat to the point that the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100, and the processor struggles to perform simple tasks (much less play a video) until it cools down.

It doesn't just happen with 720p HD or higher. It'll struggle with 540p, or even 360p sometimes.

I clean the vents regularly, I have a laptop cooler that definitely aids in lowering the temperature (having noted the differences between using it and not using it, each for weeks at a time), and I still have this problem.

Is there anything I can do to make it so that I at least have a chance of getting through the first half of a basketball game without my laptop exploding? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried searching, and couldn't find anything on this sub.

Couldn't our taste buds have "evolved" to prefer foods that are good for us (vegetables as opposed to chocolate, for example)? The laws of nature state that a species which chooses to damage itself consistently (or cannot avoid doing so) isn't fit to survive, right? Wouldn't enjoying the taste of healthy food help ensure our survival?

It seems similar to a situation where a zebra wandered regularly into an area where a bunch of lions roam, for no reason other than that it enjoys being in that area. Eventually, after a whole bunch of zebras get mauled, the other zebras would get the idea, wouldn't they? They'd stop going there, they'd keep their offspring from going there so the species can continue on, etc.

I'm no biology expert, so if I have anything wrong, please feel free to tell me exactly what. Just be nice. Please? </TEXT>

I worked at an "information desk" in a big building (basically a study/eating area for students, and a meeting place for the top university employees-- managers, execs, etc.) on a college campus about three years ago.

One day, an attractive young lady around my age asked me where the cookie shop in the building is. I directed her to it, and she thanked me.

After she left, I realized I should have made a move, and I hated myself for not doing so.

Then, I saw her later that day. I waved to her. She waved back and smiled. I motioned for her to come to the desk.

I asked her, plain and simple, "Could I call you some time?" She said sure and gave me her phone number.

One day while we were chatting about a week later, I asked her what kind of cookie she went to get the first time I saw her. She had no idea what I was talking about.

**Because she wasn't the same girl I had seen initially.** </TEXT>

Russell played against worse teams/players, but accomplished things no one else ever will. Jordan's 6 Finals MVPs or five league MVPs or 10 straight scoring titles can or have been equaled/surpassed. I seriously doubt anyone is going to win 11 championship as the best player on his team, or have the type of defensive impact on the entire league that Russell did. </TEXT>
