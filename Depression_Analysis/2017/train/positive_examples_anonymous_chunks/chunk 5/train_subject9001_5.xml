	<TEXT> Empty febreeze bottle. I would use the trigger to gauge ones eyes out, and then once I'm finished stick the end of the spray nozzle into their brain through the mauled eye socket. I would then begin squeezing until brain fluid and matter begins spraying out of the nozzle. I'm not sure how efficient this murder would be but I'm positive it would be extremely painful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What helps me is the idea that we were put here for a  purpose. We  were meant to live, and every day has the potential to better your life. Being depressed is not your purpose in life, it is merely a problem. And every single problem we face is given to us to we can learn and grow from it. There are many many things on this earth that you will never learn, see , or experience if you end your life.  Stay strong, and remember that this disease is not all you are. 3 </TEXT>
