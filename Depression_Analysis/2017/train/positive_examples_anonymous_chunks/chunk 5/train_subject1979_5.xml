	<TEXT> You have to forgive yourself. Let go of the past and be there for Seth now. Don't be so hard on yourself, life is too short.

	<TEXT> You did more than you know by being there for her! I mean it. Divorce is so hard to go through, no matter what age, and you were a safe, positive, and happy environment for her. It is so important for young minds to recognize a place where they feel safe, and you gave that to her. Keep your head up!  </TEXT>
