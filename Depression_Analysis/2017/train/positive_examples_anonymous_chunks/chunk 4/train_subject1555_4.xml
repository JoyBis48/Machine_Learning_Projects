	<TEXT> I found out that he was just using me to make my best friend jealous. she had rejected him just before he asked me out but didnt tell me about it until I had been with him for almost 6 months. when I asked him about it he just started going into an all caps rage and brought up a lot of painful memories from my past, calling me a worthless whore and telling me that I deserved everything that happened to me as a kid.  </TEXT>
