	<TEXT> Randoming is fine if done correctly and by someone that can play every hero well. Your team picked a support and a core than can function in multiple lanes and nobody has other heroes highlighted? Go ahead and random. 99% of the time your pick will be fine. And if it gets countered, well it was possible that whatever hero you would have picked anyway could have just as easily been countered. Nobody is willing to first pick a hero and the timer is almost at 0? Go ahead and random. The team has to then build around you (hopefully they do) regardless of whether you randomed or not.

Your team picked 4 cores? Don't fucking random. </TEXT>

Randoming is fine if you do it smartly and can play all of the heroes to the level of the bracket you're in. 

Team picked a support and a core than can function in multiple lanes? Random your pick. 99% of the time you'll be able to lane it somewhere without a problem, and the bonus gold at the start gives you a nice edge.

Team picked 4 cores and you haven't picked yet? Don't fucking random. </TEXT>

There's two different sides of matchmaking for a reason. Ranked should be for tryhards, unranked should be for casuals, practice or experimentation (most of the time).

	<TEXT>  Skull Basher on Sniper is actually a legit build

How? The only feasible option I can see for that being legit is having the bash chance, which is lower for ranged heroes, and we were playing against a PA. So he should have saved up for a MKB instead. I guess Basher gives you 114 health too but that's not worth spending 3k gold on as a sniper.

And if he was planning to build it into Abyssal I see the worth there if he gets jumped on, but realistically it should not be a go to item at all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> At what MMR do people actually start knowing how to play? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know things like this get posted all the time, and this actually isn't a "complaining about my teammates" kind of thread.

I've played between 1.8k and 3.2k MMR over the past year and a half. Currently sitting at 2.9k.

Back when I was sub 2k, people knew nothing and at that time myself included. 10cs at 15 minutes, running into 3 enemy heroes solo, facepalm worthy item builds, etc. 

When I hit 2.5k, it was a bit better. Usually 3 out of 5 of your team knew for the most part what they were doing or how to play the hero they chose decently. There was always the bad egg or two every game that still seemed completely clueless though.

When I popped over 3k, it seemed like for the most part it got better. People knew to farm instead of face rushing enemies at 10 minutes. People could actually land skill shots, knew to TP away instead of just feeding, etc. But I'm still finding absolute retards in most games. Last night, at 2.9k, our Sniper bought a Skull Basher. People still run into a jungle blind looking for a gank and get mad when they die 1v4 because the other team TP'd to a tower and counter ganked. 

I'm nowhere near a perfect or pro player and I know that. Obviously we all have bad games where we get off to a shitty start and can't quite bring it back around. But I don't pick heroes I'm uncomfortable with or don't know how to correctly play, and that's still what I'm seeing even in high 2k. The game I just got out of, our Clinkz flamed the enemy Tidehunter for hacking because he didn't know Orchid didn't do an immediate instance of damage and Tide was able to Blink out before Clinkz could land the first arrow on him (our Clinkz was Russian though so that could also explain his toxic nature.)

My questions would be, assuming I can continue to rise in MMR, when will I see consistently a full team of people that actually know what they're doing all the time? When does the game become more of winning as a coordinated team rather than who has less noobs, for lack of a better word? When can I actually rely on my teammates to make good decisions and play well by themselves instead of feeling the need to be the captain/coach the entire game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sniper will be outputting the most damage on their team. He is usually the #1 priority. The way to beat a Sniper is to take him out of the fight first. If you're letting him get away with barely any HP, then it's your fault for not completing the kill. 

He's annoying to play against, I agree. Just like every high dps hero though, the key is to pressure him early and gank him when he's trying to farm solo. It requires teamwork. An unfarmed Sniper is a useless Sniper. </TEXT>

If you do require a blink, there is almost always an angle you can use to get in close. Obviously you can't just face rush into him because he'll see you. Use fog of war to your advantage, or use a smoke to get behind him. 

You're making it seem like it's impossible to get on top of him. With good play by the Sniper it's by no means easy, but it's not impossible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've found the opposite to be true. Especially in 2k where you can go up against some absolutely retarded offlane combinations that make your life a living hell.

For example I played a Tiny game yesterday expecting a Batrider solo offlane, but the Sven went with him and maxed Cleave. So they just pushed the wave into the tower and continuously dove me after level 2. It blew. Even with a Magic Stick.

edit: We ended up winning the game fine and everything, and I suppose we did break even on the lane because their dives lead to a couple deaths on their end even though they killed me as well. It just made farming an absolute bitch of a time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  His isnt top 10 for anything.

Sprint makes him move at almost max move speed with boots. Maybe three other heroes have an ability similar.

He has an really good AoE stun/slow on an 8 sec CD.

Built in Bash.

His ult reduces enemy hero's armor more than all but 1 spell in the game (Weave) and also gives True Sight on a 5 sec CD costing only 25 mana.

Pro teams are picking him.

 There are so many heroes far better than him at the moment.

There will always be heroes better than other heroes in some situations and worse in others. Slardar fills a certain role (as every hero is intended to), and that role is to essentially to amplify damage onto a single target and allow them to be instantly bursted down. 

He's fine. </TEXT>

Why have I never seen this suggested? Holy shit that would be awesome. 

1. It would make the hero far more interesting because you will actually be sniping people instead of just clicking on them at 3000 range and it auto hits them.

2. All of the noobs who pick him and press R to win would actually need to get a little bit of skill in order to use the hero to max potential.  </TEXT>

Sven can get a Soul Ring with the same timing as an Earthshaker, probably even earlier considering ES's usually don't spend their first levels doing pulls whereas a Sven could. He only needs level 8 as a support to have the skills you really want. Hell, you could even leave the stun at level 1 if you don't need the damage from it, considering the stun duration and cooldown remain the same at all levels and put points into stats to increase your mana pool if you're that concerned about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It could work as a niche last pick. 

Out of the 25 most popular heroes in 6.83 pro games according to datdota, the only ones with innate tree clearing abilities are Rubick (Telekinesis breaks trees upon landing), Venge (Swap destroys trees), Slark (Pounce destroys trees where he lands), Batrider (Firefly), Storm Spirit (Ball Lightning), Ember Spirit (Fire Remnant) and Io (Tether). If you bump it up to top 50 it only adds Lina (LSA) , Enigma (Midnight Pulse), Phoenix (Dive, Sun Ray destroys trees he moves over, and Supernova destroys trees in the radius upon casting), Jakiro (Macropyre) and Beastmaster (Wild Axes). 

13 out of 50 are fine odds for me considering the level of effort some of those heroes would require to do it without a QB and gem.

	<TEXT> Someone in my 2.8k game last night was adamant about picking Treant for safe lane hard carry farmer. Claimed he was going to rush Aghs to farm the entire map and then Mjollnir because Treant is so high dps.

Although it theoretically could work, we had serious doubts about trusting someone to actually pull that off and he picked AM. We still won so I guess it ended up okay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really now?

There are only about 580 players on the Dota 2 Leaderboards showing at over 6k MMR. Europe ends its 200 player leaderboard at 6172, and China ends its at 6017. Americas and SE Asia drop to 5.7k MMR and 5.5k MMR in the top 200 respectively. Let's just do a math's sake assumption and estimate 11,000 players above 5k MMR even though that number is probably way more than the actual total, but I highly doubt less. And I think it's safe to assume that every pro is above 5k.

So what you're suggesting is that there are 4,389,000 people between 3.0 and 4.9k MMR (top 60th percentile being at 3k would mean there are 4.4 million over 3k, then subtracting out the 11,000 over 5k). The top 90th percentile in Dec 2013 consisted of 500,000 players. The top 90th percentile now would consist of 1.1 million players (if we round the current number up to 11 million). 

11,000 of those people (by these numbers) are above 5k. So 1.089 million out of the 4.39 million we need to find the top 10% are somewhere in the 3.0k MMR and 4.9k MMR range. If 5k+ only holds 11,000 players, that means 5k+ is roughly the 99.9th percentile. Meaning 3k-4.9k would consist of 39.9% of the player base, or slightly less than 4.4 million players. We already know that isn't true, because of the relatively common occurrence of MMR discrepancies you find even in 4k, where teams queuing can have a difference of up to 500 MMR (and sometimes more) between their respective highest and lowest MMR players, whereas if you're queuing at anywhere from 2-3k you're hard pressed to have that difference be more than 50. 

We can assume the players that were above 3k in Dec 2013 are still above 3k. What you're suggesting, again, is that in the span of 15 months, instead of 500,000 out of 5 million players being above roughly 3k MMR, there are 3.9 million NEW PLAYERS out of 11 million (4.4 million or 40% minus the existing 500,000) above 3k MMR. I have no idea how many of them have MOBA experience in the past, but I highly doubt that almost two thirds of the 6 million are above the skill level that would have put them in the top 10% of players only a year ago, also taking into account that a very generous number of the people playing Dota 2 in 2013 were most likely people with previous Dota and MOBA experience, already making them more skilled than someone who heard about it for the first time when its popularity took a meteoric rise. It was released for public beta in 2011. In the 2 years up to these stats being released, it'd accrued 5 million players. That number doubled in the next 12 months. 

The skill difference between a 3k player and 4k player is very noticeable. The reason for that is the lower number of players in that range. Go between 2k and 3k and you don't notice as much of a difference, although yes the difference is definitely still there.

If I had to make an educated guess, the 99th percentile (top 110,000 players) would be 4500 and the 90th percentile (top 1.1 million players) would still be somewhere in the 3k range, probably close to 3750 on the high end. I'd place the 60th at 2200 honestly. Popularity doesn't bring masters. Popularity brings casuals. The masters are the ones who've been playing this for years, and they're the ones that fill the top percentiles. Obviously there are cases where someone picked it up and excelled immediately, but that's not every player.

I calibrated ranked around December 2013 immediately at level 13. Never even heard of Dota previously except for a friend mentioning that he played it and got me to install it and try it out. I obviously knew jack shit about the game, and was quite terrible even after so many games. Got put at 1.8k. I looked through some of those games a little while back, and it was plainly obvious how terrible I was, in le reddits opinion, from my builds and stats and just remembering how I used to play. And yet back then I was almost of equivalent skill as the average player.

I'm sorry but there's no way almost half of the player base is over 3k MMR.

	<TEXT> This is anecdotal, but a game I played a couple hours ago ended up my team winning 63-26 in 38 minutes. 

We were messing around at the end with a couple lanes of racks down and 3 players on 7 kill streaks or higher (it was a massive stomp for us from the get go) and we got team wiped. 

2 of their heroes were able to buy full hearts in the span of the 2 minutes it took to get back to their ancient. 5 people on a godlike streak should only give 5k gold, right? Considering a godlike streak after 30 minutes usually gives 1k to a player maximum? 

2 of their players ended up with at least 5.5k each. Seems a bit stupid to me. </TEXT>

Do you know how to read? If you're coming from a FPS then you're used to and comfortable with WASD. WASD is far more common over every PC game than mouse movement. It's considered the standard and default (hence why it's defaulted to WASD in Dota 2) movement controls for PC games. Games that use mouse movement as default are the minority. Do games have an option to use mouse movement instead? Yes. But the standard is WASD. </TEXT>

Pretty much every PC game uses WASD as the default player/camera movement. I can't think of a game I have played where it's been different as the default. Therefore, it's what people are most likely most comfortable with if you've been PC gaming for longer than playing Dota 2.

Personally, I've only been playing Dota 2 for a year and a half. Before that I used WASD for movement of some kind in every game for the past 7 years of online gaming. It's muscle memory at this point. I have absolutely no problem changing up my hotkeys a bit and reaching the two inches with my index finger to hit another key, especially being a hardcore WoW player for 4 years where your spells required you to hit 1 through = on a consistent basis.

You can try it out, but it's not going to magically make you a better player if you're not comfortable with it. In fact, you're going to have to spend a lot of time getting used to it and you'll be worse until you do.  </TEXT>

I would love the opportunity to try that out because I play so much fucking better if I have a supportive team around me that cooperates with a game plan rather than playing completely solo, but nobody wants a 2.8k scrub on their team even if I offer to play support :( 

There are so many games I could have won if the 4 randoms on my team would have pushed towers or taken Roshan after a team fight rather than going back to farm. But usually the way it goes is 2 don't speak English, 1 is trying to go for the highest GPM instead of the win and the other is a toxic feeder. But that's Dota pubs for you. </TEXT>

Any hero with Blink initiation is great against him. Axe and Batrider come to mind. 

The key to shutting him down completely is to wreck him early game. An unfarmed Sniper is still slightly annoying, but nowhere near as much of a threat as you'd think.

If he gets farmed, ignore the team around him and kill him first in team fights. He will output the most damage on their team if left to his own devices, and he's extremely squishy because normally people build him like a glass cannon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Battle Fury should not usually be used as a damage item. It is a farming accelerator. Some heroes benefit from the Cleave effect in team fights (Ember Spirit using SoF, or Jug using Omnislash for example) but you really don't build this item for the damage at all.

It's core on AM because it accelerates his farm and makes him one of the fastest farming heroes in the game. It's core on Ember because of the synergy with SoF. Situationally, you can build one on PA as well to accelerate your farm and cleave massive crits. Not many heroes really should build this item though. 

People build it on Kunkka as well, for reasons I can understand but can't adequately explain (something something double cleave effect idk).

Troll on the otherhand is fucking retarded. I spam picked him the past two days and went 11-2. Base movement speed dropped by 10 is needed. Maybe increasing the cooldown on his ult by 10-20 seconds as well because if you have any enemy T2 down and you win a team fight, its pretty much instant racks regardless of enemy buyback timers.

Or just remove his built-in bash. He gets a free 3k gold item on a hero that every 30 seconds attacks at near max attack speed. I think removing the bash would make him trash tier in people's eyes though, which is usually what you want to avoid. </TEXT>

It's stupid. All he needs is Aquila/Phase/HoD and an alpha wolf to solo Rosh, then you group up and push. If the enemy team fights you, you win the fight unless you're extremely outplayed considering you have to blow cooldowns on an Aegis Troll or he'll annihilate your team, creating space for the rest of your team to come in and clean up, and if they don't fight you you just mow down two lanes with Battle Trance.

He responds by flaming me saying he doesn't use sound and I should have pinged instead. He proceeded to feed the rest of the game, even after I switched to pings. I hate people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to know what they base those "random" surveys on after some games are over. "Did you enjoy playing with ___ player" or whatever they are. Because 90% of those end up being either someone who was flaming the whole match or who was absolutely terrible. I always give them the lowest rating. Not sure what it accomplishes, but it makes me feel better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're talking about someone in 750 MMR you dip shit. If they're 750 MMR, obviously they don't farm fast. 

And you're also talking about someone who, if they knew how to farm heroes already, would be doing so. But you know what the biggest mistake of low MMR tiers is? Not farming! Ask anyone in this subreddit and they'll tell you the same thing. Avoid fights early on, get a gold advantage, and then go killing.

Your suggestion is completely wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A snowball hero doesn't snowball without basic items. You need to farm for those. 20 minutes of good farm on these heroes compared to fighting for the first 15 and you'll dominate. You must be new.

	<TEXT> At 750 MMR the only thing you need to do is play a snowball hero and outfarm the enemy team. DO NOT participate in early team fights. Let your team die around you and focus on farming. 

Practice last hitting in bot matches, get bigger items and levels before everyone else, and make sure you picked a tempo controller (TA, Bloodseeker, Slark, Nightstalker for examples) that can 1v1 win fights against heroes that are out of position. 

The lowest MMR I was ever at was 1.8k when I calibrated a year and a half ago. Don't rely on your team at all. In fact, I'd mute them all and just farm for 20 minutes. Then come out with a higher net worth than everyone on a hero that can 1v2 or 1v3 if needed and massacre them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  when in fact they are (generally) of equal skill.

This is the part I don't get. I'm at 3k. Half the people I get queued with make me wonder how they even managed to load up the game in the first place, another 45% seem like your average player, 3% are actually hey you know what the fuck you're doing and then the last 2% are god tier. 

I know a hell of a lot about this game from being active on this subreddit and watching pro gameplays. I can load into a match and tell my team exactly what items to build for situations, when to back in teamfights, what heroes would be best against their lineup or to synergize with ours, etc. The problem is most of the time my team doesn't fucking listen. (Trying to tell my team to take Roshan after winning a team fight when we're behind to reduce our deficit, give us another advantage, and also deny it from the enemy team. My team refuses to listen, the enemy team takes Roshan 10 minutes later and pushes to win. This happens constantly.)

I suppose it's my mechanical skills that aren't up to par with people of higher MMRs, but considering how many people (even carries) I see at 3k just auto attacking creeps or not using items/abilities when they need to I'm baffled that they're considered the same skill level as me.

And then if I manage to carry their 2-14-8 feeding support asses to victory, they rise in MMR and are viewed as higher skilled. Makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to get your diffusal before you're useful in any way. I still think he's best as safe lane to secure it asap, but I've been trying him offlane just to see what happens. With Soul Ring he's great at harassing a potentially squishy enemy carry out of lane if the supports rotate away.

I've had a 50/50 split as far as success goes, I've really only played like 6 games so far though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ideally you let your teammates initiate fights so you're not first target, but still ouputting a really high amount of damage.

I'm still tinkering with it, and not pro by any means.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Troll needs his base movement speed dropped by 10 and the health bonus halved during Berserker's Rage in my opinion. That won't kill the hero in any way, but it'll make him more balanced.

Axe...just fuck Axe. I hate that hero. No hero should be able to continuously creep cut your safe lane with a Stout Shield and RoP at level 2. It's fucking retarded. Especially if he has another hero with any kind of disable with him. You're just fucked unless it's a low skilled player. Change the scaling of his Counter Helix from 100/135/170/205 to 50/115/175/205 and it might be alright. Or cut down his starting health a bit.  </TEXT>

2 buttons on the left side, I've only hotkeyed one so far and it's my microphone key. I don't use open mic because my mic is a piece of shit and I have background noise, so this makes it a hell of a lot easier than somewhere on the keyboard.

I think they're fine to use. It's the same logic as buying $100 headphones to play first person shooters. Whatever gives you the advantage over your opponent. </TEXT>
