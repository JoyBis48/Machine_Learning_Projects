	<TEXT> A good resource for collecting books is instocktrades.com. They have most book that are available, with most at 40% discount and fairly regular sales.

I would also check out your local Halfprice Books. They usually have a decent selection of Graphic Novels which you can flip through to see if anything strikes your fancy.

One series I've personally enjoyed is Sandman by Vertigo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Avalon HD, Ravensword 2, and Dragon Ball Online.

Got first two from a humble bundle a while back and enjoy both. I feel it was way too easy to get money in Ravensword (Just grind the goblin hideout and fast travel to it once cleared, at 60g per shield dropped by every goblin it didnt take long to max out on best gear available.

Found Dragon Ball on the play store. It isnt too bad, but still has a good amount of translation from Vietnamese to be had. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a Lucifer vertigo series, which I am hIghly enjoying (just finished first trade collection), I believe it picks up after the events in Sandman Volume 4. I recommend reading those first four volumes of Sandman first, but not exactly necessary.

Now if I remember right, I think Lucifer Trades were originally printed in smaller collections, but were more recently put into thicker trades. A quick glance at the wiki page will help sort them out. 

If you enjoy Sandman, I recommend the Death Deluxe trade. It has both Death of the Endless' trades in it in addition to some other stories. One of my personal favorite books I've bought.

As for trigon, havent really read much on him.

EDIT:

Sandman Overture #3 just cameout last week and was quite wonderful IMO. Try to track down the first two issues. It isn't exactly on a regular release schedule, like several months between issues. </TEXT>
