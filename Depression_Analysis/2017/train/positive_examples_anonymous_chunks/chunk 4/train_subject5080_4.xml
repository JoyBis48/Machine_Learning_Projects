	<TEXT> Agreed. My psychiatrist, OB, and GP have all told me that my mental stability is more important to baby than breast milk. If I pop this kid out and breastfeeding just causes me to spiral, I'll gladly go to exclusive formula rather than risk my mental health.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Benadryl. It's the only way I can fall asleep anymore. If I fall asleep on my own, it's at 3am after a night of tossing and turning which, at this point, is very painful. Then I wake up every 90 minutes to either pee or jab my husband bc he's snoring like crazy. Then it takes me 15+ minutes to fall back asleep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What my doctor said is that "Metformin helps women with PCOS get pregnant by balancing out the hormones and helping ovulation.  Once you're pregnant your body will take over after the placenta is formed."  

I took it until 6 weeks pregnant and then I was on progesterone supplementation because my progesterone was low.  All of my reproductive endocrinologist, general practitioner, and OB said to go off it.  Who am I to argue with all that education?

Just listen to your doctor/midwife, (s)he really does know best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well today we got word that we got approved for the rental house we applied for.  About 30 minutes after getting the news, I took a nap.  In my dream, my husband was sleeping in the guest room (with no marital issues) but the one caveat was that the owner of the house ran a boutique out of the guest room, so my husband had to be up and out of the room by 5:30am every day, which never happens.  So there was a big fight about that.

Then I had to participate in a karaoke contest, but the focus was on the lipstick color I decided to wear during my performance.  The judge/host was a tyrant and wouldn't let me choose my song and wouldn't tell me when I was going on stage.  I also couldn't find my favorite lipstick that looks awesome on me, so I started breaking down into tears, screaming at the woman about how unfair it was.

WTF brain...

Previous pregnancy dreams include:

Recurring dream of having to get a c-section, but the doctor can't get to the baby so they just sew me back up and shrug, saying "maybe next time!"

Giving birth, and within 2 hours my baby is driving a car (as a baby-sized human), talking, crawling, walking, etc...

Giving birth to a baby whose body, when swaddled, is the size shape of a baguette, but whose head is the size of a large olive.  Can't breast feed, I have to feed him with an eye dropper and he projectile vomits after every feeding.

Freaking terrifying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mental health after my dad died while I was in college. My doctor had me on a high dose of zoloft and I was numb to most things but would break down and become really irrational. We were also in a LDR at the time. He told me recently that once he almost dropped me off after a weekend together and was going to call it off but he decided not to. The next week I started weaning off zoloft and things got dramatically better. Lower dose celexa works so much better for me anyways. 

Since we got married we've also struggled with a sudden jump in my anxiety but he's been such a trooper. I don't really deserve how wonderfully he treats me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Female here, who believes in gender equality:

Why not call it gender egalitarianism, then?  Feminism exists only to increase advantages of the female gender.  While I agree that in most aspects, men have the advantage, why aren't feminists trying to reduce the stigma attached with, say, male elementary teachers?  Or any male workers around children?  I've heard personal anecdotes of men being accused of being pedophiles for taking pictures of their daughters at public parks. If feminism was truly about gender equality, we would also hear more about certain inequalities that men face where women have the advantage and work to fix those things as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is sexual compatibility already determined before someone has sex?  If libido has been discussed before two virgins get married (like, how much each person thinks about sex) and it is determined they are a good match in that regard, there is still room for sexual incompatibility?  Learning about one's sexual identity with another person who is brand new to the game too can be a fun and exciting experience.

Not to mention the fact that sex may not have as much importance in a relationship as it does to you.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish I could tell this to some parents I know.  One mother has a 2 year old daughter who has to nurse to sleep, despite the mother's milk drying up because she got pregnant again.  So the kid just has to suck on a boob to sleep or else will cry until she falls asleep.  Mother refuses to even try crying it out to teach her daughter to self-soothe.  

I would rather go through a stressful transition period than have a child attached to my tit for its entire childhood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to think the same thing until I started looking for houses. Yes, some HOAs can be ridiculous, but most of the ones I have come across simply maintain the neighborhood to a certain standard. I don't want to live in a neighborhood where my neighbor can go months without mowing his lawn, because it makes the neighborhood look like shit. Same with putting a sofa on the front lawn or other things that make the rest of the neighborhood look trashy. 

Some are ridiculous though. My in laws are remodeling their house and they had to fill out forms to get approval for all the renovations.  If I want new countertops, that should be my decision only as it doesn't affect how the rest of the neighborhood looks.  </TEXT>

Please stay on the medication until you have your doctor's appointment, or call the doctor before your appointment (like, in the next couple of days) and ask his recommendation for the Prozac. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kill me.  I barely slept last night, maybe 4 hours total on and off.  Then I had my baby shower today, which was amazing but freaking exhausting.  Now it's 11:20pm and I can't sleep again.  Benadryl has absolutely no effect, even when taking a dose equivalent to a Unisom.  And my husband is in there after falling asleep in literally 90 seconds.

At least I have a lot of baby shower stuff to catalog, snacks to eat, and a good book to read.

Any suggestions on falling asleep other than a diphenhydramine-based medicine? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your story sounds identical to mine.  I was on 30mg Celexa before getting pregnant.  Weaned off around 12 weeks pregnant, then in late July my panic came back full force.  I am currently on 10mg of Prozac.  It's much better for baby and me to not be stressed out all the time than for the baby to come into contact with a little bit of an SSRI.  I know people who have had anxiety so severe that they stayed on Klonopin during their pregnancy and their child turned out fine.  

I'm currently 36 weeks, and I still have moments of anxiety, but the medication definitely helps.  I couldn't function at work, my blood pressure was up.  I knew I needed help.  I went back to my psychiatrist and we both decided it was the best route to go for the end of this pregnancy.  This also gives a jump start on helping with PPA or PPD.  Since it's such a low dose it shouldn't affect baby that much at all.
