	<TEXT> You're basically saying that since everyone, ostensibly, doesn't totally agree on subjective measurements, you can't argue one player as the GOAT.

That's the POINT OF A DEBATE. One person has his subjective argument, and another has his subjective argument, and you TRY TO PROVE THAT YOURS MAKES MORE SENSE.

It's what the concept of debating is BASED ON. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You can argue Russell is the most dominate player over his peers if you want, but **no one can look at a game from the 60s and one from the 90s and say they are the same.**

And no one has said they are. The point is that Bill Russell did things no one else has done. Yes, his competition was weaker, but he accomplished a whole lot more than anyone else ever has.

That's like if I play NBA 2K14 on Rookie and score 1,000 points in one game with one player. You can use the "It's Rookie mode, too easy, only reason you did that" argument if you want, but 1,000 points with one player is amazing, period. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it's impossible to compare him to the modern era to the variety of rule changes and fundamental play style differences.

It really isn't, though. Not if you know enough about basketball.

You can look at stats, video, his performances against the best players/teams (single-handedly kept Wilt below his average in 100+ career matchups), etc.

For God's sake, the man was VOTED BY THE NBA as the greatest player of all time in the 80s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Video and stats of the games don't exist or aren't recoverable

They do. There's plenty of video, and professional historians have researched and recorded advanced statistics for Russell's era. That's how we know how great his defensive impact was-- the Celtics' team Defensive Rating skyrocketed as soon as he came to the team, and fell off a cliff the minute he retired.

 there's no objective means of weighing statistics.

Why not? All you have to do is look at what the rest of the league was doing, and how that player performed relative to the average. As long as you have enough knowledge to properly account for any extenuating circumstances, it shouldn't be a problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think it's hard to judge Russell because of his era, and the fact that his team was loaded with HOFers during an time with few NBA teams.

Those players were Hall-of-Famers due to Russell. Look at their statistics, research them, watch them play, and tell me with a straight face that Russell had an All-Star team around him.

 Jordan is just easier to compare, because the number of teams is the same and the talent level hasn't changed dramatically from then to now.

But they have. The rules are different (to Jordan's benefit), players are much better defensively, players are more athletic, and defensive schemes are more advanced. </TEXT>

In my opinion, he clearly has a case as the greatest player of all time over Jordan or whoever you have up there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was 13 years old, raised Christian, with no one in my family (including myself at that point) even considering the fact that the Christian God might not exist.

Christmas was always one of my favorite holidays, and it was my mother's, too. She and I were very close to one another, and we had a lot of fun every year setting up decorations and receiving/giving presents.

Then, in the Christmas season of 2002, I noticed that she was less jovial than usual and was spending a lot more time in bed than usual. Me and my dad decorated the house, which I usually did with my mom. I was told she was just a little under the weather and would be fine soon.

On December 22, she passed away from cancer. Three days before Christmas. Three days before our favorite holiday. I was 13 years old.

I was broken emotionally and probably still haven't recovered. It wasn't long after that when I decided that I refuse to worship a god who would take something like that away from me at the worst possible time.

Then, my big cousin, who I was closest to after my mother passed, was killed in a car accident last year. He was 26 years old. I am, and have been for a long time, perpetually depressed, feeling like I want to cry pretty much 24/7. But not when I was around my cousin. He was such a happy, funny, effervescent, and most importantly, nice guy that it was impossible for me to be depressed around him. Every time he came over and we played video games together, I never ever felt depressed. He and I would crack jokes and have as good a time as you'd ever see me have. And now I'm never going to see him again.

At that point, I firmly decided that if God exists, he can send me to Hell, because I will absolutely not bow before a deity whose existence hasn't even been close to being proven, and who (if he DOES exist) is taking away the few people in my life that I have a strong relationship with.

If he wants to condemn me to the underworld because I don't believe he exists, due to a significant lack of hard evidence, then so be it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shawn Michaels is amazing at telling a story during a match (his "Concussion" match vs Orton was barely even a wrestling match, yet it was still extremely entertaining, at least IMO), and it's really this simple-- he knows what he's doing in the ring more than anyone in WWE history (arguably). I've never seen him botch noticeably, and he knows his opponent's tendencies, as well as just how to work a match or even one spot, that it's almost impossible for him to put on a bad match.

He's one of those guys who either never makes mistakes, or when he does, you can't even tell, because he covers it up.

Remember when DX vs Rated RKO (I think) broke down because of Triple H's torn quad? Orton was running around like a lunatic, confused as hell (not a slight-- he was very young), but Shawn handled the situation as perfectly as he could have. On top of all that, he's also arguably the best face character of all time.

**tl;dr** Shawn Michaels is the Michael Jordan of pro wrestling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has always been one of my favorite parts of wrestling. Seeing wrestlers kick out of credible finishers, with no/minimal delay between the finish of the move and the pin (due to an incapacitated referee or a wrestler "crashing" due to fatigue after using his finisher).

To be honest, this isn't what it might look like-- a list of the best matches in which one can find at least a single false finish. I intend this to be more about discovering/discussing which finishers are most credible, and/or which wrestlers have the (kayfabe) durability to survive the most effective finishers of the last decade-plus.

This list is going mostly off of memory, with me going back to find video to confirm and make sure I'm right. Others are free to contribute by correcting mistakes on my part, listing occurrences I missed, telling me any finishers you think should be added, or anything else that you feel might add to the thread.

I also included some instances of "No-selling," where a wrestler takes a finisher, and immediately recovers, usually to apply a ground-based submission (Undertaker's Hell's Gate, Lesnar's Kimura Lock, etc). I understand that this is very much a judgment call, so I'll listen to any and all opinions regarding this aspect of this list.

I'll post links to as many videos of each occurrence as I can, but for now, I'll leave it as is until I see how well-received this thread is. I apologize to anyone who might want video of the below instances.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the positive feedback everyone, and the suggestions for entries/moves to be added. I'll definitely try to add everything that was pointed out some time today.

Keep em comin!

**EDIT 2:** Just a request to make things a little easier on my part-- not trying to be too demanding, but it'd help me out a lot if when you guys let me know "[X wrestler] kicked out of [Y finisher] at [Z event]," to provide video if possible. That'll make it easier for me to add it to the listing, and it will confirm it more quickly than me having to look everything up myself.

Suggestions are, of course, still welcomed. In fact, they're allowed.

**EDIT 3:** Undertaker's no-sell of the GTS and Punk kicking out of the Tombstone at WrestleMania have been added, as well as a few others, and some links added.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Six years and 364 days later, he lost a one-on-one match to CM Punk on SmackDown (06/22/10).

After the seven-year anniversary of Kane's unmasking passed the next day, he went three months without being defeated, with most of that time coinciding with his reign as World Heavyweight Champion.

Kane broke a mirror, unmasked against his will, and had a horrible streak of losses and bad breaks for the next *seven years*...

Then, as SOON as seven years passed, he went on a very solid winning streak (11 straight wins from the end of June to the beginning of October), and during that winning streak won his first world championship in over a decade.

Coincidence, or an amazingly thorough angle that was never even brought up?

**EDIT:** For those wondering when Kane broke the mirror-- it was a backstage segment right before the match that probably isn't well-known at this point (I probably wouldn't have known, either, if I hadn't found this video on my hard drive one day when I was bored).

	<TEXT> Gotcha.

Also, to summarize what you said about 3-4 vs 4-3, it seems like 3-4 is better against outside runs (since you get the extra speed with the additional linebacker), whereas 4-3 is good against inside runs, with the two tackles attempting to clog the middle. Is that right?

And for what it's worth, I just noticed that the Patriots' 4-3 pretty much looks like a 3-4. Instead of four linemen in three-point stance and three linebackers behind them, they have three linemen in the 3PS, with Ninkovich and Mayo at the line of scrimmage, flanking the linemen on either side. How should I treat this formation? Could this work similarly to a 3-4? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, fair enough. That sounds pretty good for me, since I'm an offense-first guy (might have been obvious, given the team I use).

One more quick Q-- let's say I see a one-deep safety look, but the defense is actually running two deep safeties. One of the safeties might come down into the box (even though he's still going to play deep), but I should be able to exploit the fact that he's too close to the LoS with deep routes to his side, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quick question regarding position play-- Jerod Mayo is listed as a ROLB in Madden, and Spikes as the MLB. Generally, if I'm gonna run a defense with only one linebacker (like Dime), I'd want my best linebacker on the field, right?

	<TEXT>  Basically, if the defense is showing one high safety against a pass-heavy formation like trips right, the hole in their defense is likely to be on the left. 

But, just to be sure, one high safety could also mean that they have three deep defenders, right? I suppose that's something I have to identify at the snap-- look to see if the other safety and a corner drop back into deep zones as soon as the play starts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually always thought about that. Generally, a guy can see a cute girl that he doesn't know and try to charm her with small talk, and then ask for the digits. For the most part, worst-case scenario is that she'll respectfully decline, as long as the guy doesn't come off as an ass or doesn't take no for an answer. Most of the time, at the very least, the girl is flattered.

Gay guys don't have that luxury. Straight men aren't flattered by having gay guys make a move on them. Plus, there's no way to tell for sure if another guy is gay, and if you hit on the wrong straight guy (read: probably around 90% of straight guys, because people are stupid and judgmental), you could definitely get into a fight.

That must suck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, thanks a lot for the speedy reply. I'm pleasantly surprised at this. Anyway:

 As for alignment, the numbers just refer to linemen then linebackers. A 4-3 is 4 linemen and 3 linebackers.

Yeah, I know that much (I think). Nickel would be essentially 4-3, except the third linebacker is replaced by a cornerback, and Dime replaces the second AND third linebacker with cornerbacks, leaving one linebacker on the field.

That's why I figured counting linebackers could help (IIRC, linebackers always have jersey numbers in the 50s). Two guys wearing 50-something? Nickel. One guy? Dime.

What you said about the nose tackle and identifying 4-3 vs 3-4 is exactly what I was talking about when I said I used to be able to do that. Relaying that information to me is a great place to start, and I appreciate it.

Also, since we're talking about it, when I'm on defense, how do I decide between 4-3 or 3-4, or even Nickel? They're all somewhat versatile formations, aren't they?

I use New England by the way, if that helps. Their linebackers have pretty good size, Jerod Mayo is an absolute beast, and I think Hightower and Spikes have good speed and tackling ability. Plus I have Wilfork on the nose, and Rob Ninkovich is a pretty fundamentally sound LB/DE (if I'm wrong about any of this, feel free to correct me).

So, given my personnel, how should I decide between 4-3, 3-4, Nickel, etc.? Dime is mainly for defending the pass-- I know that much. But between the other three formations I mentioned, which is good for runs, or short passes, or maybe situations where the defense has a ton of options (like 2nd and 5 or 6 maybe)?

If I have any other questions, I'll let you know... if I haven't burnt you out by now. Thanks again. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I want to learn advanced football strategy to help me in Madden (might sound silly, but I've seen it work) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-30 03:30:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The first thing I guess I should do is let you know how much I know about the sport. I'm no newb to advanced football strategy, but I'm definitely not an expert either. 

I know things like how to read the safeties pre-snap (one deep means Cover 1 man/zone or Cover 3 zone, two deep means Cover 2 man/zone or Cover 4-- not always, obviously, just mostly). However, **I can't look at a defense and tell you for sure if it's a 4-3, 3-4, Nickel, Dime, etc.** This is especially difficult in Madden, since you can't see the players' numbers pre-snap, so it's impossible to simply count the linebackers and go from there. I'd have to be able to look at the alignment of all the defenders and memorize what each formation looks like in this regard (which I used to be good at, but not anymore).

I'm also okay at identifying zone/man right after the ball is snapped. If the defenders turn their hips to chase the receivers, man. If they stay squared to the line of scrimmage even as receivers run past them, zone. Easy. But at the same time, **I find it difficult to identify (or even make an educated guess of) zone vs man before the snap.** I'm not even sure if this is possible for someone who doesn't play the quarterback position at an organized level, but if it is, I'd love to learn how.

I'd also like to learn things like reading blitzes pre-snap, knowing when to adjust your blocking schemes (i.e., block left/right/pinch/aggressive) before the snap depending on what the defense does, how to adjust to certain strategies during the course of a game, etc.

Would you guys be willing to help me with this? I know a lot of people would probably recommend some of the websites that specialize in teaching this knowledge, but I learn better by actually talking to people and absorbing information through conversation, as opposed to simply reading a generic write-up (not saying they can't be helpful, but I learn better this way).

Thanks, guys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is something that can't be completely identified via statistics, but which stats exist, if any, that come closest to doing so?

Is there a site that shows quarterbacks' completion percentages by distance that the ball travels? I know they have a stat called "Air Yards," which is a measure of how far a QB throws the ball when completing a pass (basically passing yards minus yards after catch), but I don't know if that would work very well.

Any suggestions? </TEXT>

But anything that has to be reloaded (web pages, etc.) will not work (I'll get the same error message I'd get if I turned my internet off).

I couldn't figure out why until someone on this subreddit suggested it might be my torrent program, so I did some testing, and discovered that when the program isn't running, my internet has no problems at all. And when the program *is* running, I get the issues that I described earlier.

Is there anything you guys would recommend here so that I can run my torrent program without compromising my internet connection?

	<TEXT> This question came to me earlier today, when I realized that I could probably make at least a few bucks if I sold a miniature collection of rare currencies from around the world.

The reason I would never sell it is because my late mother (whom I was EXTREMELY close to) gave them to me on a business trip when I was 12 (she passed when I was 13). Her job required that she travel globally, and she spent nearly all my life collecting coins and what have you from different countries, because she knew I loved rare currencies.

Every time she left for a business trip, I would cry myself to sleep almost every night because I missed her so much, so she made sure that at least once a week, I got a letter from her telling her how much she misses and loves me. One day, a small zipper pouch came with one of the letters, and it had [this picture](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UcAUEMTbGcw/UZ0bChxy_xI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/D1YH81lzbN8/s1600/Guess+How+Much+I+Love+You.jpg) on it. It was the last gift I ever got from her, and I cried when I saw it in the envelope with the letter.

I keep it right next to my bed on my table, I never move it, and I never put anything on top of it. Every time I pass the end table, I look at it and smile while holding back tears.

I would never even think about selling it. For any price. Ever. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-09-24 16:11:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The idea is that if you go back in time and change things from the way they were normally, things in the future could be drastically different in a seemingly unrelated way. For example, in Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder" (I think), one of the characters steps on a butterfly's wing while in the past, and finds that in the "new" present, words are spelled differently, and things like that (presumably because of an incomprehensibly long chain of events).

Wouldn't that apply to going to the past, on its own? Just your presence in the past can alter things. You could leave footprints where there weren't any before, or cover up the tracks of something that *was* there. You could startle a person or catch their attention as you walk by, which keeps them from focusing on what they were doing, which could change their day, which could change the area, which could change the world. Etc.

But characters always seem to say "Don't touch anything, don't move anything, and be as discreet as possible." Not "Man, even just being in the past is probably gonna make the present noticeably different." If I'm wrong about this, feel free to correct me. It's been a while since I've seen/read a work of fiction involving time travel and the butterfly effect. </TEXT>

For example, I love to simply touch up and down a woman's body with my hands, and do nothing more. I could do this all night, without any intercourse or anything else, and be completely satisfied. Of course, if a woman was awake and you literally did that for 5 straight hours, she'd get bored or annoyed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I see it as a colloquial term of endearment between friends

That's exactly what it is. But for some reason, black culture condemns the use of the word by white people, even if it's clear as goddamn day that it's just a synonym for "friend" or "homie." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is true (well, kinda-- hispanics are allowed, too).

It's stupid for black people to do it, but it is indeed true. And this is coming from a black man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think he's saying the fact that people on the Internet aren't typing at random makes this quote fallacious, since (it seems) that the "monkeys" are being replaced metaphorically by people who use the Internet.

Of course a bunch of people typing coherent thoughts on a keyboard won't produce the complete works of Shakespeare, unless they choose to. This is totally different from the Infinite Monkey Theorem.

I think that's what rasmustrew is saying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is actually a really good question. There are two ways around this:

* I can ask for her consent when she's awake, and if she trusts me enough, I usually get the green light. If she says she'd be uncomfortable with it, I accept it and let her know I won't do anything (I tend to stay awake later than my partner at night, and I love to spoon).

* Or, she can fake it. Sometimes they'll wake up, and if I know it's a regular thing between us and she's fine with the fact that I'm doing it, I'll say something coy like "Just go back to slip." You know, half-joking. At that point, she just sighs or rolls her eyes facetiously, and does so. I've been told that when this happens, she actually didn't go back to sleep, and just faked it.

* I've also been told that they've woken up, but without me realizing it, and they continue to pretend they're asleep.

It is, as you inferred, a very tricky paraphilia to manage, but I haven't had any complaints yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything at all.

Also note: This is NOT a rape fetish. It's not based on a lack of consent. It's based mostly on being in charge without having to assert yourself, and having the freedom to do what you want without your partner finding it weird or dissatisfying (at least for me). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Depression is hilarious sometimes. And by "hilarious," I mean "ironically cruel." </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've been taking anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medications, and they're actually helping. Good news, obviously.

But it turns out to be somewhat of a lose-lose scenario. When I'm miserable and depressed, obviously that's not a good thing.

When I'm actually somewhat happy (and don't feel like breaking down into a heap and sobbing because I feel like complete shit for damn near no reason), it doesn't last.

Because almost as soon as I start to feel "happy" (I use that word tentatively-- "not cripplingly depressed" would probably be more accurate), I start thinking about my life. I start thinking about how my life isn't really that bad. I start thinking about how I'm having a good day and everything isn't darkness and misery.

Then I start thinking about how all that is going to go away, because eventually, I will die. I'm sure this won't surprise anyone, but I don't want to die. I don't want to not exist. I can barely fathom the concept.

I try to think of life like a plate of your favorite food. You eat it, you enjoy it, and you eventually finish it. But are you sad when it's all gone? No, because you're full. You've had as much as you want. Hopefully, life is like a plate of food, and by the time we finish it, it won't be an emotional burden, because we've done nearly everything we wanted to and won't necessarily find it to be heart-wrenchingly tragic that we will die.

But I'm starting to think this line of reasoning is less and less plausible everyday.

Writing this actually made me feel a little better. But not by much. I'm still in a psychological malaise over the fact that all this is going to be taken away from me eventually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for being so late with the answer, but if you still care, he said that the craziest thing he'd ever seen as a pro basketball player happened during a tournament in South America. The winner of the game would advance to the Finals of the tourney, and my dad was on the away team.

My dad was "kicking ass" as he claimed (and trust me-- believe him), and when there was like 2 minutes or so left and his team was up 18, the entire crowd started throwing C and D batteries at the players and officials. And they actually let them finish barraging the players with Alkalines and finished the game.

If you meant the craziest non-basketball thing he's seen, I can ask him that. </TEXT>
