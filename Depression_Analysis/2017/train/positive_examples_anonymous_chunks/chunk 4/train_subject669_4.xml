	<TEXT> It depends on the context really. The last time I was at a conference and talking about social identities, I used the word "lesbian" because it's a widely understood term, no confusion. Among friends or acquaintances I say "gay". When with other LGBT friends I might jokingly say dyke or vagina enthusiast. I entirely avoid homo or homosexual, it's sounds cold and technical. Plus conservatives make it sound like some terrible pathology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm black and it is NOT my job to be responsible for black people I've never even met. Every person is responsible for their own actions. I've never called statistics racist (they are what they are) but I'm an individual and deserve to be treated as such. And fyi, there is no such thing as "the black community". We all have different beliefs and lifestyles. It varies by state, age, socioeconomic status and education.  </TEXT>

Can't make that shit up. Ignorance fuels these type of traditions. There's also the fact that if you don't get the procedure done you'll be considered unclean and unable to marry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not that simple. I'm black but I don't have sex with men, so I'm lower risk than most. Plus my blood type is sought after because I can help people with sickle cell anemia. You can't just say black=HIV. It's a skin color not a behavior, like being gay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't remember where I read this but I saw some article awhile ago hypothesizing a possible link between handedness and sexual orientation. It said gay people were more likely to be left handed on average. But like I said I'll have to dig up the source. Interesting stuff.  </TEXT>
