	<TEXT> I see your point about Agravaine. He needs to go if Arthur is going to succeed. 
However, what I dislike about him is that he acts like a leech. He doesn't act independently and needs Morgana to tell him what to do to get his own revenge. If he was a real villain, he would act on his own accord and not on someone else's. 
And you know that once he is exposed, he's just gonna run away like a coward.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This episode made me optimistic about Arthur's progression. His outpouring of emotion seemed genuine and I hope that he will uphold his word in future episodes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you on the snow and rain thing. It's amazing what a little precipitation can do. All of a sudden it's like "OMG!! THERE'S RAIN/SNOW ON MY WINDSHIELD! I NEED TO DRIVE LIKE A MORON NOW!" My dad was one of the smart parents who taught me how to drive in both.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are lots of unmarried couples who have kids and live together, with every intention of staying together. And there are lots of parents who are married with kids that get divorced anyway. That's why I'm questioning the purpose of the institution of marriage.  </TEXT>
