	<TITLE> Does HM sell any blazers that are 'long'? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-05 20:36:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wear a 44L because I have long NBA player arms.  I went into HM and saw a blazer I loved but they only had it in 44R.  

What are my options?  The girl I was with took a look at the sleeves and said there wasn't enough material to get more than an inch and a half with a tailor.  That wouldn't be enough length.  Any alternatives to HM?  I really liked the low cost but slim fit.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks.  One more question... with an exercise like squats is there an alternative to high reps?  I can do plenty of bw squats but I can barely do one legged squats.  Is there an in-between progression? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do you avoid boredom during high rep exercises? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-03 15:58:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The main reason I can never stick with body weight exercises is because after about 20 reps I lose interest and can't get the motivation to finish.

How do you guys push thru and do 100+ situps, 50 burpees, etc ?

Especially when breaking them into smaller sets isn't an option because you need more reps to challenge yourself but can't quite progress to an advanced version of the same exercise.

Also, how does hypertrophy apply to this as well?

EDIT:  I will check out the FAQ's for better progressions.  Thanks for the replies though!

	<TEXT> It's going to take time.  There's nothing you can do.  What is it that keeps reminding you of her?  If you can you need to do everything to remove those reminders.

I had a girl break up with me but we had mutual friends on twitter.  Someone would RT her and it would ruin my day.  I created a filter in Tweetdeck to remove any tweets with her name in it.

It sounds simple but little stuff like this helped me heal and not think about her all the time.  If there's nothing triggering the memory but your scumbag brain then the only thing I can recommend is keeping yourself occupied so you don't have time to think about what could've been. </TEXT>

Then we end it because it feels like the right thing to do.  But afterwards we feel like shit because the girl is still sad anyway and now we're lonely.  I'm going through this process as well.  If I would have known about this subreddit I would've posted it here.

	<TEXT> I like what this subreddit represents and all, but I feel like not giving a fuck is either in you or it isn't.  The guy that got dumped by his ex on Valentine's Day isn't going to all of a sudden stop being depressed because of a few words on here.  It takes multiple failures and an internal resolution to get to that point.  And the time it takes for that to happen is different for everyone.

Most people have to get to a point where they decide *"enough is enough!"* and change their life.

I'll leave you with a quote from Anthony De Mello.  It's in the context of relationships but I think it applies here:


"It didn’t make sense to me for many years until I suddenly discovered 
that people have to suffer enough in a relationship so that they get disillusioned with all
relationships. Isn’t that a terrible thing to think? They’ve got to suffer enough in a 
relationship before they wake up and say, “I’m sick of it! There must be a better way of 
living than depending on another human being.” And what was I doing as a 
psychotherapist? People were coming to me with their relationship problems, with their 
communication problems, etc., and sometimes what I did was a help. But sometimes, I’m 
sorry to say, it wasn’t, because it kept people asleep. Maybe they should have suffered a 
little more. Maybe they ought to touch rock bottom and say, “I’m sick of it all.”  **It’s only 
when you’re sick of your sickness that you’ll get out of it.**  Most people go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to get relief. I repeat: to get relief. Not to get out of it" </TEXT>

See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/16z92o/28m_broke_up_with_24f_did_i_do_the_right_thing/)


The problem is I underestimated the friendship I had with my gf.  It wasn't perfect but at least I had someone who was obligated to put me before everyone else.  At least I had someone to vent to.

Now that I'm single and depressed nobody is around.  I have friends, but I always feel like I'm bothering them and they all have other priorities whether it's kids or a significant other.  

So this leaves me by myself.  Who am I supposed to talk to?  I feel like nobody understands me.  Even when I was in a relationship I was the type of friend to drop everything and be there for a friend in need.  


I don't have the best relationship with my family either so I truly feel Forever Alone. </TEXT>
