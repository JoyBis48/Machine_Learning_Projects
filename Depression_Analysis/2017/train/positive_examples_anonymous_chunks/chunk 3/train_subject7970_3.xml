	<TEXT> Hello :) I am 21 / f, looking for a server to play on. I can't play most modpacks because I don't have a desktop, just my laptop. I have started the first bits of both AS and ME3 in singleplayer but I miss having a few people around! So who would like to join me and has a server? :) Or do you know a server where they seek players? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But this is singleplayer. It makes a huge difference since this Diogo is not pushed away or even worse, off the edge because there are no other people on the track and there are no items. (although this way he doesn't get mushrooms either) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if anyone ever keeps checking this thread after Monday but I was wondering if anyone has some sort of playlist made with all of the music that Chad plays during his streams. I can't watch his livestreams because he streams at 3AM for me. Even if I listen/watch them later, I use them as some sort of podcast, it's in the background while I'm studying and I just listen to what he's gotta say and his music. And I really like the music, I just don't have the time to search through his streams for his music. Anyone can help me out here? Or does Chad have a website where he lists the music [just like sevadus does?](https://www.sevadus.tv/music.php) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow that's impressive! I had been thinking some more and I eventually chose for night blindness as my topic, also because I have personal experience with it. I'm thinking of maybe making a column-like article about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I missed a few of these. Not because I was late but just because I have been way too busy the past few weeks. But hiiii! I probably failed my exam and I also handed in something that wasn't even looking like a scientific article.. I probably didn't pass the big course from the past two months :(

In other news, I have to write another article but this can be about anything as long as it's related to biology. Preferably something cool and easy to understand for everyone because this writing course is about writing to a larger public. For example news articles or news reports or interviews. I can't find a nice article :( I was maybe looking for something or someone important in the history of biology and trying to make a report about it because it is its anniversary but I can't really find anything. For example, Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was published 155 years ago in 10 days, but yeah.. I don't like the number 155 there. If it were 150, sure! Something like that, maybe someone has an idea? :) </TEXT>
