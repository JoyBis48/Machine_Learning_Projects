	<DATE> 2014-12-03 02:39:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a matter of preptime. I've heard and seen they are both ridiculous at it (beware of circle jerkers). 

Round 1: both get a week of preptime to figure out how to appease the hunger of Galactus.

Round 2: both get 6 months to figure out how to take down a higher tiered member of a different universe. (Loki vs Superman, Batman vs Thor)

Round 3: both get 5 years to prepare a contingency for something that they should not/cannot do by themselves. Situations are Loki vs Darkseid and Batman vs Thanos.

Bonus 1: The two fight to incap, no prep. (Bats doesn't kill in character)

Bonus 2: one month prep, fight to kill (bloodlusted) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anecdotal evidence follows: 
Marijuana can provide a psychological dependence, rather than a physical one (like, you will mentally crave it rather than physically) and this can be just as addictive and difficult to break as a physical dependence. One of the biggest signs to determine if someone is addicted to marijuana is to check their spending habits. If they are sacrificing necessities for weed, then you have an addict on your hands. 

Hell, anything can become an addiction if it fucks up the rest of your life enough  </TEXT>
