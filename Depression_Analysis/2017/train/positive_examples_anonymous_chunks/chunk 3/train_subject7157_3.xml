	<TEXT> I created my own make up channel recently and I feel that it'd be a great journey for me; to help me learn new things at the same time while making videos and grow.  I also believe this will hone my skills over time.  Are there any tips you can give while creating videos? What should I do and shouldn't do?

Your comments would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just noticed the lower left picture that has a black line on my face - my fault. I cleaned that up already and it looks better without it. So sorry in advanced if anyone sees it lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am struggling with getting my eyebrows right. This is my first picture posting of me (I used my iPhone)... I hope the lighting isn't too dark.  If it is, please tell me and I may take another clear picture with the DSLR. Many thanks!
