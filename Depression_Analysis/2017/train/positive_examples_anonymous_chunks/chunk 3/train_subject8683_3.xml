	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Backstory if you want:

From Philadelphia, played for the Boston Celtics for only one year before a knee injury. Wasn't as good after his knee was repaired, so he played overseas (mostly in Argentina) for roughly 10 years.

Went to Rutgers Camden in New Jersey, shattered pretty much every basketball record that ever existed there, and is the only player alumus to be drafted by the NBA.

He's about 6'5, I (24M) go about 6'4, and he's about to turn 60. Why this seemingly random information? To let you know that despite being damn near three times my age... I can't beat him one-on-one. He plays every day at the crack of dawn and has the best jump shot I've ever seen in person. If you've never seen an NBA player just shoot around casually (even way past his prime), it's absolutely amazing. They're pretty much superhumans compared to us, even guys like my dad who weren't superstars.

So go ahead. AMA!

**EDIT:** A minor caveat. I did say "AMA," but there are some questions that he might not be willing to answer, so if that's the case, I'll just tell the person who asked.

Basically, I'm saying all questions are fair game, but I can't guarantee he'll answer them all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Are all the files contained within a single folder or are you trying to identify duplicates across multiple folders?

Many, many folders (hundreds), across two internal hard drives.

 Are you considering all traits of a file when identifying duplicates? Ie. if you have two documents which are identacle in every way except the filename of one is Document.docx and the other is Document (1).docx, are they still considered duplicates?

The program I use, Digital Volcano's Duplicate Cleaner, can search for:

* Same file name
* Same content
* Same artist/title/album (audio)
* Same size
* Same created date
* Same modified date

 What duplicate-finder programs have you already tried which seem to be so slow?

See above.

**EDIT:** For what it's worth, I wouldn't mind doing this in segments as opposed to all at once. I know I can break it down and tell the program to only check for duplicates in such-and-such a folder, or time period, or file size, etc., but that might exclude files that aren't in the search parameters that actually are duplicates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I would try OpenDNS' IPs just to check (208.67.222.222; 208.67.220.220), and maybe remove the IPv6 DNS settings.

So I should set those IP addresses under my IPv4? And how exactly do I remove the IPv6 DNS? Just choose "Obtain DNS server address automatically"?

 Also, are those settings in your router what Comcast told you to use? I would use (Get dynamically from ISP) unless told otherwise.

I changed it to static in an attempt to [fix a problem I had connecting to online games over Xbox Live.](http://www.pcworld.com/article/242961/how_to_open_up_nat_settings_on_your_xbox_360.html) But I still had the problem in the OP before changing it.

 EDIT: Also, just a minor niggle, probably nothing: Set DNS through EITHER the computer's or the router's settings (preferably the latter).

If I do it through the router, should I just leave everything under "Network and Sharing" (on my laptop) at default or "Obtain automatically from ISP" or whatever? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, initial basics-- Comcast provides my internet, and I use the internet on my laptop with a wireless connection via router.

The router and modem are no more than ten feet away from my laptop at all times, which (I believe) eliminates the possibility of a weak signal (plus the fact that whenever I check the properties of my connection, the signal strength is maxed out).

This also allows me to constantly monitor the status of my connection by looking at the router/modem-- whenever my internet stops working, everything is the same as when it is working. Connection lights are lit, all status lights are green and not blinking, etc. The "wireless connection" logo in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen also stays the same (no yellow triangle with the ! inside).

To specify what I mean when I say my internet "goes out": At random times during the day (I have yet to figure out any type of pattern), web pages won't load, and internet-based programs/devices (instant messenger, torrents, Xbox Live, etc.) will not connect to the internet. However, if any of those programs are *already* running when the internet goes out, they'll continue working; but if I close the program and tried to start it back up during the down time, it won't work. Hope I explained that well. Pretty much, anything that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (unlike websites) will continue to work even during this down time.

I attempted to change my IP addresses with [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup). Here are some screencaps of my settings:

* [IPv4 settings](http://2.imgland.net/a97T--.png)
* [IPv6 settings](http://2.imgland.net/sje9LH.png)
* [Connection details](http://2.imgland.net/0p-n45.png)
* [Connection status](http://2.imgland.net/I5Dvl0.png)
* [Basic settings (via router interface page)](http://3.imgland.net/f3F5a0.png)

Any help would be appreciated. If you need any more info, feel free to let me know if I left something out. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Having A/V sync issues with a program called "MkvToMp4." Anyone familiar with the program know a fix, or another program that can convert large videos (as in file size) without reconverting/transcoding? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-18 14:36:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have videos (MKV and M2TS, mostly) that are anywhere from 1-3 gigs in size, and I need to convert them to MP4 (or AVI, I think) format so I can stream them to my Xbox 360. I used this program at the behest of a user on this subreddit, and it worked much better than software I had used in the past. It generally takes no longer than 10 minutes to convert (since it doesn't reconvert or transcode if it's in H264 already) despite the fact that most of my files are at least an hour long.

MkvtoMp4 converts M2TS files fine-- no issues with the sync of the audio and video. Converting MKV files, however, is a different story entirely. Every time, the audio is always about two seconds ahead of the video. I've tried changing certain settings, but nothing has worked so far. I've used search engines to troubleshoot, but haven't had any success.

Does anyone know a possible solution, or perhaps an alternative piece of software?

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm kind of weird, too picky, or whatever, but I've always loved this in any type of competitive game, but mostly fighters.

Games with matches against one-on-one opponents, where you can take your time, play defense when you need/want to (by using an opponent's moves against them if you're good at countering/blocking, for example), and at times you try to out-think your opponent instead of doing everything physically and/or frantically. That's normally what a real fight between two professional fighters is like. 

Am I mistaken here and most fighting games actually are like that? Are there certain fighting-game franchises (or iterations of franchises) that have this feel more than others? How do they achieve that type of gameplay successfully while still retaining the fun factor? And lastly, does anyone disagree with my opinion on this? </TEXT>

As far as meeting people, I don't want to meet people. I hate people. People are the reason I spend 18 hours a day locked in a room with no light and ignoring almost any call I receive on my cell phone.

I can almost guarantee that forcing myself to go would do more harm than good for me. The only reason I'm even considering it is because I owe my dad big time. He is truly the *only* reason I have a roof over my head and food on my plate. He refused to abandon me when I was in desperate straits, and he goes beyond that very often (for example, allowing me to live in the house he owns, rent-free).

So basically, I'll feel like shit if I don't go because he's done so much for me and I'd feel like an asshole for disappointing him.

Or, I can feel like shit if I do go, because it'll be boring, because I hate crowds, I hate people, and I hate being out of my comfort zone. </TEXT>

Who's gonna help? Nobody. The best my father does (and I appreciate it) is help me out when I need money for my meds. Other than that, he thinks this whole issue of psychological imbalance isn't even real.

Us 20-somethings (or at least myself and most people I've seen) have parents who come from a generation where a lot of people thought depression/anxiety/mental disorders were all either fake excuses for laziness, a product of literal insanity, or simply hypochondria. I really wish people would read up on things or ask around. My dad's not an idiot, he's just used to old-fashioned values and beliefs. But he's not much of a reader or one to watch educational/documentary programs.

I just want someone, ONE PERSON IN MY LIFE, to understand that having severe depression/anxiety/both is just as bad as being terribly ill physically.

Instead, they think it's not, because there are very few palpable physical symptoms, many of the habits that occur because of depression can be easily confused with laziness, and if you're extremely unhealthy psychologically, you don't need to go to a hospital to stay alive (with obvious exceptions). </TEXT>

I don't understand what you mean by "smoke and mirrors," but it's simple.

This (my home) is my comfort zone. My mind doesn't like it very much when I leave my comfort zone. I need to stay in it as often as possible to avoid spending the rest of my life in a straitjacket.

The only time I'm willing to drag my broken, psychologically crippled ass out of bed is to go buy something I want/need, or to go to work. I don't think it's asking too much that I wish to remain in solitude otherwise. </TEXT>

He lets me live in the two-story house that he owns, while he and my stepmother live together a few minutes away.

Funny thing is, I've never been close to a situation like that where I'd have to potentially die to keep someone else from doing so. I don't know how I know I would do so for my father... I just know that I would. Without a doubt. </TEXT>

I'm not 100% sure he's correct, but it seems plausible and makes sense to me.

My advice would be to see a doctor or a psychologist. The latter if you think talking to someone about your problems would help (a lot of people in your situation are the complete opposite, and it's understandable), or the former if you think psychiatric medication would be better (it's worked for me... kinda).

	<TEXT> A few months ago, I told my dad I'd go to my stepsister's wedding (Sunday, August 11th-- tomorrow as of this writing). I'm not close to her at all, or my stepmother, but my dad just married my stepmother and he really wants me to go.

One problem-- I feel like utter and complete shit right now because of recent events, and I know I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow. I guarantee he's not gonna want to hear any of that, though. But if I was in the house coughing up blood, vomiting and having a fever of 102 degrees, I bet you he wouldn't give me shit about not going. Those physical ailments I just described are pretty much analogous to how I feel psychologically right now.

* "Man up and go."

* "Stop making excuses."

* "You're being ridiculous."

Would you say that to someone who was extremely sick physically? Of course not. But if you feel like shit psychologically, for some reason, it doesn't count.

Also note that I'm 24 years old and I live alone, so he made it clear that since I'm an independent adult, the choice is up to me. It's not a "If you don't go, I'm gonna beat your ass" or "I'll kick you out of the house if you don't go."

My dad is a really tough guy, and he doesn't show great sadness and such very often. But if I don't go, I get the feeling he'd be as close to heartbroken as he's been recently, because he (like many people) doesn't understand what depression and anxiety are like separately, much less combined. 

**EDIT:** Another reason he'd be really upset is that he'd think I was doing it out of selfishness, disrespect, or both, not because I feel terrible. Do you guys think there's any way to convince him otherwise? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This is what my GPU usually looks like after I've been browsing the web (no videos, no games, nothing that should stress the graphics card).](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png) Not good. So I decided to do the following:

Shut my computer off for the night (not sleep, not hibernate, completely shut down), and thus, it cooled down for a good 7-8 hours. Then, I turned it on, cut off my wireless internet connection so no programs that use the internet would activate automatically, and didn't run any programs save for three: Task Manager, Speccy (to monitor GPU), and Core Temp (to monitor processor cores).

After 58 minutes of idling (most of which was spent with the display turned off, since it automatically does so after two minutes-- just the display, not the computer itself. Like a screensaver), my GPU was at 65C, and my processor cores were at 59 and 60C respectively. I had absolutely no applications running (if you had looked in my Task Manager "Applications" tab, it would have been empty).

The computer was also hot to the touch, despite the fact that, just to make it clear, I didn't touch the computer once after starting it up and running the Task Manager, Speccy, and Core Temp.

Now, I know there a few possible solutions, and I have some questions about those.

* Compressed air to clean out potentially clogged fans/heat sinks. I'm REALLY broke right now, but I'm trying to scrounge the money to grab one or two. Let's say I do, and I use it, and it still overheats? Then what?

* I also have a laptop cooler that I used to use that actually helped keep the computer a little bit cooler, which is better than nothing. But there's a short in the power cord now, and I don't have any soldering tools or expertise to fix it myself. I tried to search the internet for somewhere I can buy just the power cord, since buying a new cooler would be pretty pointless. Nothing wrong with mine except the power cord. Does anyone know where I might be able to find a power cord for [this cooling pad?](http://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Laptop-Cooling-Turbine-SGA-4000-KKNF1/dp/B004G603E2) Also, is there maybe a common household item(s) that I can use until I get a new cord/cooler?

Thanks, and if I left anything out or wasn't clear, please let me know. </TEXT>

If I have the CPU idle, my GPU temp shouldn't ever go over like 40 or 50C, right?

Also, what's defined as idling? Would that be when the load is under a certain number (and, presumably, "System Idle Process" is in the 90s)? Can you leave a computer on as long as you want and still have it be considered idle? I was going restart the computer for the night so it cools all the way down, and then leave it on for 30 minutes with no programs running, except Speccy to monitor the GPU.

Good idea, bad idea? Did I have any misinformation above?

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there a way to check if background processes/bloatware are even the problem? I don't wanna go through all the processes and then find out it was never an issue.

My CPU generally stays at a load of 5 or below when I'm just browsing the internet or something. It's just that I think the video card overheats for no good reason, which overheats the motherboard, which makes my laptop feel like the surface of the sun to the touch.

**EDIT:** For example, right now, like I said, I'm doing nothing but browsing the web. I've got 12 tabs open, but nothing at all that should cause a heavy load. I'm running no other programs except Core Temp, Speccy, Yahoo IM, AIM, and Task Manager.

Despite this, my GPU is at 69C (very high, according to [this](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/09/GPU2.png)), and doesn't appear to have any plans to drop below that at all any time soon.

I'm not watching any videos, I'm not using anything like Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects, and I'm not streaming anything anywhere. I'm convinced my GPU just sucks balls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think it's unfair to call someone's marriage that ends in divorce a result of solely bad decisions. People do change. 

I can understand that. I just have an aversion to the logic in the OP since it implies that the nature of marriage causes divorce, not the people who get married.

If a person is careful who he/she marries, when he/she marries him/her, and makes sure that everything is as stable as it can be, I'd say they have a much better than 50/50 chance.

The fact that half of American marriages end in divorce, or whatever the hell the number is, has no bearing on a specific marriage. It's not the idea of marriage that causes it-- it's people's bad decisions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Overall system specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/Speccy.png)

[Motherboard](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/Motherboard.png)

[Processors](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/CPU.png)

[Graphics card](http://3image.com/images/2013/08/08/GPU.png)

All taken within the last 2 minutes.

Now, I've heard (and not necessarily saying I don't believe) that most high-end laptops can handle 100C without potential system damage. But the issue here is that the computer reaches temps as high as 80 or above (shown in screenshots), despite the fact that I only have the following programs open:

* AIM
* Yahoo IM
* Firefox (admittedly, 9 tabs, but just Google, a message board, Reddit, Wiki, and TV Tropes)
* uTorrent
* Task Manager

Now, I believe my graphics card (NVIDIA Quadro FX 2700M) is known for being a piece of shit, mostly in terms of playing video... but I haven't watched any videos since I turned the computer on an hour ago (confirmed in Task Manager). I haven't run any other programs other than Speccy, which I closed after taking the above screenshots.

Like I said, I haven't done anything but browse a message board or two, as well as Reddit.

It seems like underclocking/undervolting are my only options. There's no way I can take my laptop apart to clean the fans (I have no experience whatsoever in doing so), and I can't get my hands on a cooling pad or a can of compressed air (long story).

How much can I underclock/undervolt? Is there a limit? I'd really like my laptop to stay below 60C at almost all times. If this means a sacrifice of performance, I can live with that. I just hate the feel of a scalding hot laptop (I can feel it even as I type), and it causes the computer's CPU Usage to jump to 100% at random times when I'm not doing anything that would consume enough power to take the laptop to full load.

Any comments, questions (if I left out important information or anything), suggestions, all are welcome.

Thanks, guys. </TEXT>

On [this page](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#setup), step four of the process reads:

*Select the Networking tab. Under This connection uses the following items, select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) and then click Properties.*

As you can see, the graphics card overheats (which I think is a consistent problem with this specific video card), which causes the motherboard and processors to over heat, and that causes my laptop to stall and struggle to run the simplest of tasks because of the excess heat. Plus I don't think that a constant temperature of ~75C is healthy for a laptop.

I'm looking for anything, *anything* at all that even has a chance of maybe helping with this problem. Software, BIOS updates, changes to any settings on the computer (such as under Control Panel, etc.). Anything. Anything at all.

Thanks in advance. If you need any more info, it shouldn't be a problem at all for me to provide it. Feel free to tell me if I've omitted anything important. </TEXT>

I can't watch a high-quality video (even on YouTube) without the graphics card overheating, which then overheats my processors and motherboard. At that point, the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100%, and stays there while I can't do much of anything. I can move the mouse and click things and everything still technically functions normally, just *extremely* slowly. As if the computer is struggling to carry out the simplest tasks because the video card is so weak but is also trying its hardest to maintain quality video feedback (which it doesn't more often than not).

	<TEXT> [My computer specs, courtesy of Speccy)[http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png]

And when I say it "goes out," I don't mean that my modem/router doesn't pick up a connection. It still does, and I'll stay connected to my wireless network on my laptop, but web sites won't load. However, if I have something running that runs perpetually and doesn't have to be reloaded (like Xbox Live, instant messenger programs, torrents, etc.), they will stay connected to the internet (i.e., torrents will still download, I can still send/receive IMs, can still play games online, etc.), even while I can't access web pages.

When this happens, nothing on my router/modem changes. All the lights are lit, and it shows that I'm connected to the internet.

I made this thread before but forgot about it, so I wasn't able to confer with other users. I was given the following advice:

***You could try adding Google's DNS to your settings, it's 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. Or some other DNS service.***

***Try this. It sounds like a service on your router is crashing (probably DNS) and the 2 or 3 minutes if how long it takes your router to notice and restart the service. Using an external DNS will solve this by removing your dependency on the crashy DNS server.***

So, three questions:

1. Is this the best way to remedy this? If not, what is?
2. How do I go about doing this?

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TITLE> MKVtoMP4 program converts .m2ts files fine, but has audio/video sync issues with some .mkv files </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've attempted to convert four MKV files to MP4 format. The first three had the audio out of sync with the video, but one of them had no sync issues whatsoever.

Any ideas as to what the problem could be? Should I post the codec info for the videos that didn't work and the one that did? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it possible to keep my laptop's core temperatures under 60-61°C (specs and more info inside)? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> **NOTE:** This is a re-post from last night. No one responded (I assume they wouldn't, since it was late), so I hope doing this isn't against the rules/rediquette. I did read through them both to make sure it isn't, but if I missed something and it actually is against the rules, I apologize.

[Here are my system specs](http://3image.com/images/2013/06/30/Spec.png), courtesy of Speccy. As you can see, my graphics card kinda blows (I wasn't doing anything that should strain the video card-- not watching videos or playing games. Just surfing the web), even though I believe it was touted as one of the most powerful when it was released.

My laptop is a Dell Precision M6400 workstation (released in 2008). I will admit that at times, I do use strenuous programs-- mostly Sony Vegas for video editing. I have a CM Storm laptop cooler, but there's a short in the power cord and it won't work unless I hold it a certain way, and I can't do that and use the computer at the same time.

Unfortunately, I can't afford a new laptop cooler, much less a new computer. Are there any ways to keep my laptop cool consistently, or to cool it down when it gets past my preferred temps (without shutting it down or putting it in Sleep/Hibernate mode)?

I've actually heard of using ice to keep one's laptop cool-- does this really work? I can't remember the specifics, but I definitely remember reading that at least twice on this subreddit.

**Also, a disclaimer-- I'm 99% sure that I won't be willing to take the laptop apart at all. The warranty expired a long time ago, and I know jack shit about advanced computer hardware.**

If you need any other information, don't hesitate to let me know. </TEXT>
