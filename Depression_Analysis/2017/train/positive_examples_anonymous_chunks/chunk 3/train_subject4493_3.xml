	<TEXT> I'm totally the same way! I started looking at cute clothes and makeup and even painted my nails too. I went to /r/skincareaddiction and spent money on some nice products for my face. 

I think I avoided those things before not because I was so "above" them but because focusing on my appearance depressed me. Now that I'm trying to be healthier I find a ton of girly enjoyment out of shopping and yesterday I even got a haircut and waxed my brows haha! 

So good for you, it's all a lot of positive things going on!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you think a lot of it has to do with pressure from other people? Especially since you have issues as the day goes on. I know I wanted to cheat and told my boyfriend we should get pizza. He isn't in charge of my diet so he said okay, and for a minute I felt like he had validated my decision to cheat, do you know what I mean? I ended up feeling bad and we didn't get pizza, because I need to hold myself accountable. But there were definitely times in the past when I allowed myself unhealthy food because I was out with friends or family. It's hard to feel in control I think when everyone else is eating crappy!  </TEXT>

I'm trying to be more positive. I'm going back to school go finish my degree this fall and I can't tell if I'm super excited or insanely stressed. Maybe both. 

I also just started dating someone seriously (the first relationship I've had after my divorce) and I have no idea what I'm doing. Ahh! 

But thankfully I have keto in my life haha. One thing I can actually control and feel good about! Oh, and today I'm getting a hair cut so I'm excited! I'm seeing a really talented hair stylist who is usually totally booked but someone cancelled. So I'm pumped!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would use the keto calculator in the side bar and only put in a small calorie deficit. When I started, I had a calorie limit of 1600, which was good for me because I was full enough despite still having cravings. Now I eat around 1200-1400, sometimes more if I want to indulge. 

What kind of foods do you eat? If I find myself hungry I usually eat a handful of almonds or I make fat bombs. The large amount of fat makes my stomach happy and I am way less likely to binge. I still track everything to be sure I'm under my carb limit. 

Good luck. I tried keto a few times before but only recently did I start it and stick to it without cheats. It might take a few runs to figure it all out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't speak for everyone but I felt very little of the side effects of initially being in keto. I took a magnesium and potassium supplement and drank lots of chicken broth to keep my sodium intake high. 

I planned meals so that I wouldn't cheat and made sure I was drinking enough water. 

Honestly, there will always be reasons not to do keto. There will never be a perfect time to start. Might as well just dive right in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally awesome transformation.

I've been on keto for about 3 weeks, no big slip ups. I simply feel better. I used to emotionally eat and now I do not. I had bad anxiety and could not sit still, now that I am eating low carb I am so much more calm. So basically, those things push me to stay doing keto. I feel better, therefore, why would I want to stop doing it? You need to find your own personal reasons to keep going!

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! I'm on week three of keto and day 1 seems like it was yesterday! Seriously, keto is the least diet-y diet I have ever been on and I love all the awesome food I can eat (MEAT lol). 

One thing that helped me immensely was my fitness pal, if you don't have one get one, because I have tons of friends from /r/keto and /r/xxketo. You should add me, my username is sperhauk on there (and anyone else can add me as well). It's nice to have a lot of internet buddies holding you accountable and inspiring you! 

I read something on /r/GetMotivated that said something like, you already know what it's like to give in. What would it feel like to keep going? That inspires me so much. 

I also don't have a huge budget to go on when it comes to keto so bulk buying foods (especially meat) and planning meals goes a long way into saving money!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have issues with depression and anxiety and I definitely feel a huge improvement. Maybe it's because I'm low carb, but it could also be that I'm just feeling good by doing something good for my body. I also get a nice mood boost when I see that I have lost weight. 

My depression usually makes me say "I can't" to myself, so sticking to keto helps me fight that feeling. As for my anxiety, I could barely sit still before keto. Now I feel so much more calm and relaxed, and I barely ever have mood swings.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you know when you're looking down at your phone and the screen turns off and you are met with a reflection of your face? And then if you're like me you get depressed because you realize just how much fat appears under your chin?

WELL after two weeks on keto I SWEAR it's gotten noticeably smaller! I thought, maybe I'm holding the phone higher than usual. But I moved it around and still, my chin fat has totally shrunk haha.

This is an awesome victory for me because the fat face in phone reflection occurrence was one of my wake up calls I needed to lose weight! Sooo yeah things are going pretty good.

PS This sub is amazing and you gals are huge motivators! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I am very sensitive to body sensations, for example, being too hot or too cold makes me anxious, or being sick, or having any kind of pain. Especially when my heart rate increases or I feel flushed. I have basically been trying to avoid being in the sun or doing any kind of physical activity. 

BUT I know that exercise helps anxiety. So for the past few days I have been getting up super early to go for a walk and jog a bit, so that I won't get too hot and I stop if I get panicky because of my heart rate. Well today I went for an awesome jog after work, the sun was shining, and there were (gasp) even people around where I was running, and I WAS FINE. I had some anxious moments, especially immediately post run when I started focusing on my heart beat, but I am calm now I feel just awesome. 

I know I have a ways to go with my anxiety but this is the first time I ever really said fuck you to my anxious feelings and just did something good for myself! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it's never the skinny healthy relatives, it's always the overweight or obese ones. Like do you hate your life that much that you need to resort to criticizing other peoples' weights. I think they believe they get a pass because they're old and I'm young, and young girls "should" be thin. Whatever! 

The same birthday party my uncle asked me if I was a lesbian. Just out of the blue. Like wtf. Who ASKS that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck that guy. A relative I hadn't seen in a while at a birthday party just randomly sidled up to me and told me I got heavier. Like no one fucking asked you. You've been fat the entire time I have known you and I dont comment on it! Fuck. People are rude. Try not to let it bother you! You've got us girls on here to give you support :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have a scale and I don't think I will get one. I think it would just discourage me, especially hearing everyone talk about water weight and weight gain on their period. I just started so maybe I'll want to weigh myself eventually, but right now I just weigh myself whenever I'm at my moms haha!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always had issues with emotional eating, and I have a ton of anxiety and depression, so I'm worried I'll go off track from keto (today is my first day!). 

If I do start to get really stressed and anxious I'm gonna take a bath and then play an epic amount of video games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would be interesting. I'm in a big city but the surrounding areas are pretty country, which makes sense why dudes would be hunting/fishing/holding guns. A lot of the dudes who live in the city just have a ton of pics of them in bars. </TEXT>
