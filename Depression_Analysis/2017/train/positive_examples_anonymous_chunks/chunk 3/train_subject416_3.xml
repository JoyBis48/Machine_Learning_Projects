	<TEXT> Something I do which has really helped me was to write down three things I was happy with every day - at first it was only small things, that I took a shower or that I made a proper meal ... Then, when I felt really horible, couldn't sleep I looked at the list and tried to think about the stuff I had written down and not the misstakes I made. </TEXT>
