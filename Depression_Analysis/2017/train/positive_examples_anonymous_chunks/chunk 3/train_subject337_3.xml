	<TEXT> “Three of the four elements are shared by all creatures, but fire was a gift to humans alone. Smoking cigarettes is as intimate as we can become with fire without immediate excruciation. Every smoker is an embodiment of Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and bringing it on back home. We smoke to capture the power of the sun, to pacify Hell, to identify with the primordial spark, to feed on them arrow of the volcano. It's not the tobacco we're after but the fire. When we smoke, we are performing a version of the fire dance, a ritual as ancient as lightning.”

	<TEXT> I was a 17 year old girl at one point in my life. What the top commenters are saying about trying to talk to her about it without being too harsh or threatening to punish sounds like it would be the most effective. I'm sure most of us can remember a time when we were in our late teens and our parents trying to punish us was more of a joke than anything else. At 17, she's nearly an adult, and while she will obviously still be under your rules at home, she will see herself as and want to be treated as an adult. You also sound like you understand that concept of letting her form into her own person as well and I commend you for that. Remind her that she could end up in serious trouble if she's doing illegal things. It sounds like she's a smart kid with good schooling and possibly college aspirations so a firm reminder about not messing that up could potentially go a long way. </TEXT>

Dated a guy once for about two months who told me he had a propensity for sticking his dick in crazy, and I was thinking, "ok, well I'm relatively normal, so it should be good." Nope. He turned out to be the most arrogant, self-centered person I'd ever met and it was simply impossible to please him. Any opinion or idea that differed from his was considered "crazy". Dropped that like a hot potato. Ended with me telling him "maybe you're the problem." </TEXT>
