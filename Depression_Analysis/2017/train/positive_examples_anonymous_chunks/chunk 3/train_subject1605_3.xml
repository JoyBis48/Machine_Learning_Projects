I broke the back window of a cargo van once. Was loading up a t pole to take back to the shop after a hotwire passed, pulled a ladder from underneath, jimmied the pole a little bit back(without knowing) and broke a back window on a company truck. 

Now I make sure I have clearance before Clarence clears me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on if you have a citizen working that tile after the improvement is completed. Citizen management can be adjusted if you click on the city and look at the drop down menu on the right.

If your city is not well fed, the ai may choose to put a citizen on a farm before hills or a mine. Or, if you have bonuses to tiles that may seem more useful. (Like if you have the sacred path pantheon with give +1 to jungle tiles.) 

Long answer short, yes your worker will likely be produced sooner, but if you want to make sure, citizen management in the the city screen is a good reference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's more the idea that you have taken a pain reliever boosts its perceived ability upwards of half. 

So, if you took a sugar pill and was told it was tylenol or whatever, you would have some reduction in pain. Likewise, if you took a pill and were told it was a sugar pill, the pain reduction would be diminished. 

And this study was for OTC pain relievers, not opioids.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its actually a brilliant move. They drown out competition, increase consumer confidence so they buy those big trucks again, and when the prices go back up there will still be competition, but the price will be even higher, allowing them to step in and buy the companies supplying the tar sands type oil. 

I mean yeah there's some niche shit to it, but damn, I hope they use lube on us later. Of course it might be too expensive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. But the level at which they decide to produce does have a direct effect on prices, in a less supply = higher prices way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you figure? Instability equals a much less stable market. One government falling in the region has a huge impact on the market price for oil. 

And no serious coalition will form, its like herding cats, who have guns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My point was more of once the oil prices start going back up hard to reach oil like the tar sands is going to become a viable source again. 

"Which could count as a geopolitical win in the Mid East region." 

We want that region as stable as possible, the fracturing of Iraq is the perfect example. Removing the leaders of a country with that many different tribes and sects all wanting the money is insane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a delaying of the inevitable. I do think the Saudis are trying to drive the competition away, but as long as there is money to be made... 

Another aspect people don't get is that unless the US subsidizes oil in a serious manner, we will still be effected. Oil goes to market first, then it ends up at the consumer.  </TEXT>
