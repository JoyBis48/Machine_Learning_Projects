	<TEXT> Hey there! I'm 15/F, and I'm really interested in space travel and exploration, engineering, and technology. I don't do much outside except photograph sunsets and sit outside quietly (I get tuckered out after climbing stairs), but I'm learning physics and hoping to get to calculus, too. Music: [Gorillaz, Django Reinhardt, Neon Indian]. Shows: [Star Trek, Cosmos, every 90's Cartoon Network show in existence]. Hobbies: [Journaling, reading science fiction and non-fiction, collecting magazine articles and clips]. I really would love handwriting letters. Let me know if you're up for it. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nuclear fusion reactors are currently being developed, and if successfully built, they can create a substantial amount of energy (more than nuclear fission), and produce less nuclear waste. ITER is currently working on it, and I believe some companies, such as Lockheed, have also considered it.
