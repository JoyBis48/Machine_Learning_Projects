	<TEXT> Interesting, I was born a female (identify as well) and went through the same thing. Hated my budding breasts as a middle schooler and broke down in tears when I got my period. I wore sports bras all the time to try and conceal them. Felt like my life was over for some reason. I remember getting into epic battles with my mother over wearing dresses to church,  but I was not having any of that shit.

I'm 23 now and am no longer uncomfortable with myself. It's really weird how this stuff (identify and so forth) works. For what it's worth I am a lesbian though. I hope you get the change you desire! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can I ask how you correlate breasts with womanhood? Many women (like my sister for example) are practically flat-chested or have them removed for surgical reasons, but don't seem to feel dysphoria. What is it about your penis that bothers you? I'm just trying to understand what you're feeling. Would you rather have a vulva, clitoris, period etc? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Former Biolife employee here, there's a lot of in-house training that goes into doing phlebotomy (needle sticks). While the majority of the people in a center aren't nurses (maybe 4 tops) there's a ton of reading and training videos to go through before you even do a stick and then a month of shadowing before you're able to do sticks on your own. If you're not cut out for handling needles you'll get stuck doing reception. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, Xanax is a benzodiazepine which has more of a sedative, muscle relaxant effect, very good for panic attacks. 

Beta blockers can mediate the physical effects of anxiety, like the fight or flight response. Such as increased heart rate, sweating etc. It has other medial uses also.  </TEXT>

I swear I've exhausted all my POC options and can't find non-white girls for the life of me. Like you, I can't really see myself with a white girlfriend and I like femmes (also femme), but I feel like white chicks are my only option or remain single for the foreseeable future lol. My going to school at a PWI in a small Midwestern town might have something to do with it:/ I really want to move </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that sometimes happens when people don't have regular contact with animals. My dad was like this until I adopted a husky, and soon my dad worried about the dog's feelings as much as ours. It made me smile when he took the dog out for a run with him because "he looked like he needed some entertainment." They've definitely bonded over time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first time I felt like I actually fit in somewhere. In high school I was the sweet, but incredibly awkward kid. No one in particular picked on me, but you get tired of always feeling like the odd man out. It sucks to feel like you missed out on milestones and memories. Come freshman year of college I was determined to change my life and not be an observer anymore. I found some balls and went to the rugby team's practice session alone and inexperienced, and had a blast! For once being an athletic female who likes video games didn't make me weird. 

Five years later many of those people are still my best friends and they totally shaped my college experience. I even met my first longterm relationship through a teammate. It's awesome to have a group of friends that feel like family and to let your guard down with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. My personal favorites with good sound and comfortable for long term wear. They are lightweight and ear pads are very comfy: [Sennheiser HD 598](http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-HD-598-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0042A8CW2/ref=sr_1_5?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-5)
2. [Bose AE2i](http://www.amazon.com/Bose-Audio-Headphones-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B008YUNHK8/ref=sr_1_34?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842178 sr=1-34) Super light-weight and cushy. Noise-cancelling.
3. [V-MODA Crossfade M-100](http://www.amazon.com/V-MODA-Crossfade-Over-Ear-Noise-Isolating-Headphone/dp/B00A39PPCG/ref=sr_1_9?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-9) These fit my head really well and have good noise-isolation. Sound is good for my songs that are rock or hip-hop based. Probably the most aesthetically pleasing out of the bunch.
4. Either of these models are great for sound quality and build, but they tend to be a little heavy for long term usage: [Audio-Technica ATH-M50](http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U/ref=sr_1_2?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-2), [Sony MDR7506](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ref=sr_1_7?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-7), and [Beyerdynamic 80 ohms](http://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-770-PRO-80-ohms/dp/B0016MNAAI/ref=sr_1_14?s=aht ie=UTF8 qid=1419842099 sr=1-14)

These are my recommendations out of the headphones I own. I have no complaints about any of them. </TEXT>
