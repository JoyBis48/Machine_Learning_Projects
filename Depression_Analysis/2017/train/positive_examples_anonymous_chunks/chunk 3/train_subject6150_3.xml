	<TEXT> I noticed you are making a casual deck and didn't include balance, tinker, channel or fastbond. This should probably be fixed... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your input! I included a couple more duals as well as nixing the storm cards, I tried forcing it a couple times and it was far too weak. I was kinda aiming for a more multicolor oriented cube. Should I add more multicolor to emphasize this? Or will this just weaken my cube overall?  </TEXT>
