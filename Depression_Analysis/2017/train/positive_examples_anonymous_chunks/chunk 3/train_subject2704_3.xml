	<TEXT> Personally i liked twilight princess a lot better. Skyward sword was just bleh. I was super disappointed by the game overall. I think it was annoying having to buy everything and constantly fly around back to the main city. I just came out of the game not liking it at all. All the other ones ive played a million times, that one i probably wont even finish. What I really just don't like is the motion controls. I feel like i'm flailing around. I don't have a wii u yet, but I was hoping that they would mostly do away with that, or at least make an optional control to no have to swing remotes around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't like the clutch on the new bike. I didn't like the riding position.  Just my opinion. It didn't feel faster,  it felt sloppy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah i wouldn't bother again.  Not without a few one an one with good instruction. The group was mostly people who have been on track before. It was intimidating. All i went for was to demo some new bikes  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went out on a ZX10R and then a 300r and both times i was just way too uncomfortable. I felt so nervous. Both times. Just destroyed my confidence. I got back on mine to ride home and felt awful on it. Like my confidence is just shattered.  </TEXT>
