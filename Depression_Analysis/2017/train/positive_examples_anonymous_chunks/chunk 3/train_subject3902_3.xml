	<TEXT> This is interesting because we somehow got around to talking about pills and dosage in a recent lecture actually. 

Part of it is to do with how you use the pill as a product. Certain pills might be marketed in small doses per individual pill for safety reasons, e.g. so you don't accidentally harm yourself taking too much; one less concentrated pill on its own isn't going to be so harmful. Also so that you can take smaller doses than one might normally need, should you wish (I'm talking things like paracetamol, asprin, everyday over the counter type pills).

But a lot of the time it's for general ease of dosage, particularly if they are prescribed pills that you yourself are meant to take regularly to a prescribed schedule. For instance, it's easier to remember to take one slightly weaker pill per day than a slightly stronger pill every two days, as the routine you maintain in doing so is easier to remember, and also with a weaker pill, the damage of missing one would be less (I'd imagine). This way you're more likely to receive the right dosage because you are more likely to take it correctly.



It's also why a lot of birth control comes with placebo pills for seven days, rather than simply a break of no pills. I'm not sure how familiar you are with birth control pills but with the most common type you basically take it once a day for 28 days, then have a break for seven days (have yourself a period), then resume with it. With the brands that come with additional placebo pills that don't do anything for the seven days, rather than those that simply give you 28 days worth of pills on their own you just keep going without breaking your routine, no potential difficulties in trying to remember where you last broke off etc.


Sorry for my dreadful examples, but hopefully you get the idea was trying so so poorly to convey :p

EDIT: 21 days, not 28, rather </TEXT>

I'd love to try it, and who doesn't think the idea of owning and caring for a bird of prey would be cool? But I've no idea how people go about starting with it. You obviously can't (or rather shouldn't) buy a bird of prey without first giving it a go and finding out if it's really for you and learning a whole lot of background stuff. But from where?

Like, where do you even go to learn about stuff like that outside of the internet?

	<TEXT> American Gods would be cool. I think HBO was going to make it into a tv miniseries(?) but then it just hung around in development purgatory before getting abandoned. 

Failing that, A Handmaid's Tale or the Wasp Factory would be cool options.

Also, two of my favourite books ever, Titus Groan/Gormenghast would make a great film/films. They were made into a miniseries back in 2000,  it was so-so, has Stephen Fry in it and a bunch of others, a feature length film would be wonderful though.

Yeah, Brave New World would be interesting to see on the big screen.

EDIT: Turns out there was a Handmaid's Tale film...huh </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT][Short anime story] Two panda(or other bear) cubs are journeying somewhere, they start fighting and somehow end up lost because of it </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-31 18:27:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This just came to me last night. When I was little I had a VHS tape and it had some short animated kids stories on it. I can't remember if there was any rhyme or reason as to the things on it, maybe it was things we'd recorded off tv, but one of the stories was about a couple of panda cubs.

It may have been in anime or Western style, I'm unsure, but basically the two panda cubs (possibly some other type of bear cub) are travelling some
where together. Starts off with one of them saying they were bored, which I remember because I had to ask my Mum what 'bored' meant.

Eventually they start squabbling and, I don't know, smash the world or cause some sort of rift (possibly something to do with that part of the world being made of crystals)? At any rate, it ends with them being separated, either from each other or with no hope of ever getting home again.


Something depressing like that. The moral of course was "don't fight or quarrel".

Anybody? I feel like I would definitely recognise the voice acting if I heard it (American accents). Please help me recover this bit of my childhood :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interbreeding with wolves and dogs does sometimes happen, however, some dog evolutionists argue that the grey wolf may not be the sole ancestor of the modern dog anyway, rather it could be some other canid like the jackal or something similar. At any rate, we need to remember that dogs aren't wolves, they *are* their own species, one artificially created through their ancestors' ongoing symbiotic relationship with humans. 

I reckon, although as someone else said, there is no way of predicting what evolution will do, that we could reasonably expect to get a mongrely sort of 'street dog', as we see in dogs living on the fringes of human settlements today, the type of dogs we think early proto-dogs living alongside humans would have looked like throughout most of the species' history. There'd be variation depending on geography and so on, but probably a medium build type of dog, not too chunky, not too anything, fairly generic. But that's just my speculation.

Selectively breeding dogs for certain breed types is only a relatively modern phenomenon, and it is the Victorians we have to 'thank' for a lot of selective pet breeding, and for the rigid breeding of dogs to a particular standard or appearance. There have been breeds and types before this time of course, but breeders were more concerned with performance; a shepherd might breed his best herder or whatever, hunters might select for dogs with good retrieval skills, you get the idea. Companion or pet breeding was similarly casual, and of course, with less strict rules about roaming, and less spay/neutering, dogs tended to just do the biz with whoever else they damn well pleased. What I'm saying is that there's so much variation in how dogs look, and it's not always been necessarily down to us intentionally breeding for it.

If you'd like to learn more about the history of dogs and their place alongside humans, I highly recommend the book 'In Defence of Dogs' by John Bradshaw. Hope that was even remotely helpful. Like I say, I could be totally wrong, and I'm just speculating (please be gentle, Reddit people) :3

Edit: Ofc I'm not saying there is no influence of their ancestors in the dogs genetic makeup, just that dogs are now pretty much their own species, and so long as they inhabit an evolutionary niche alongside humans, I don't personally think they would 'revert' to wolves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's cool, I didn't know that. 
I've read a couple of other short pieces by Palahniuk that I thought were just great, Fight Club just left me underwhelmed :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Children of Men was great both in book and film form, but I honestly felt like the two were completely different stories, but for the fact that there are no children happening. It's one of the film adaptations I've seen that's the least similar to the book on which it was based, just a completely different tone, focus, everything, even down to the fact that men are impotent in the book and women are barren in the film (or whichever way around it was :p). 

I'd still have a hard time deciding between the two, though in terms of preference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Close one for me to call but I'd maybe just have to go with the book this time. But man I love both so much... </TEXT>
