	<TEXT> Let's see. I was impressed by Jason Jordan's move set. Perfect for the brand of champions that WWE Creative usually goes for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get what you mean by you feeling that NXT superstars feel like your "children." I really want Bo Dallas to do well, just like most preceding him (The Shield and The Wyatts). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been really impressed with Sami Zayn and Tyler Breeze (more than Adrian Neville). Plus, I love the Vaudevillians gimmick.

What do you all think? </TEXT>
