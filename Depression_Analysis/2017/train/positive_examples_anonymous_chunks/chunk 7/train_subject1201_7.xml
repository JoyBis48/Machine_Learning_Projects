	<TEXT> I feel like you just described my relationship with my Father. I've got to the stage, where-if I don't say goodbye then he will do nothing but continue hurting me[mentally} Nothing I do pleases him, he's a terrible husband to my Mother but she puts up with it and he's an aweful role model for my 2 younger brothers. The next time I visit, I'm going to tell him exactly how I feel and why, in private of course. Then I'm never going to look back again.

I'm looking forward to this day. I know there will be a back lash when my Father tells my Mum. But I'll tell her it has nothing to do with her, I still love her and it's up to her if she wants to stay in contact with me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Family break up is always bad. I have my daughter every other weekend now. She's 6 years old. I'm her Mum-her Dad won custody when he kicked me out to get with the neighbour he was cheating on me with. He got custody because I was too weak/nieve at 18 years old to fight properly in court. By the time I got my act together it was too late. No matter what happens between your ex wife and you-try to keep things as routine as possible for your daughter. If you haven't already-contact a solicitor. It's better to have an agreement on paper over custody than nothing at all. 

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That happens all the time and you just have to learn to blatantly keep the gap closed between you and the person in front of you. If there's no room there, then they can't stand there-also you always have the option of calling the bouncer, and very politely/innocently telling him about the problem. The more sweet and innocent you come across to a bouncer the more chance you have of him doing something about it.

I've worked in 6 bars in six years and all the bouncers work that way. 

Also, always smile at bouncers within the club, say hi etc. Make the bouncers recognise you, it helps too. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She is obviously a drain on resources currently. However, give her a chance, send her on some training courses if possible. Give her every opportunity to learn the skills she needs for the job. DON'T dissmiss her so quickly, as she may really want to do well and progress. If after a few months-nothing has improved then it's time to talk to the 'powers that be' within your company and discuss your reasons why she should go. Try to be kind to her as using her looks, is probably all she 'currently' knows how to do. 

p.s Don't forget, depending on what you're selling aka cars/building materials{are most of your clientèle male?}  put her on the floor, even if she's only giving them a small amount of info or offering tea/coffee, male customers will want to stay longer. Beware though, female customers could feel threatened by her-if she is that gorgeous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be very careful of doing this. 1}In the future the Father may go for full custody and/or try to be controlling over your daughter. You will have to deal with your daughter asking the question of why she doesn't live with you when she is older(age 6 or 7ish} My situation is what you currently want. Except I didn't choose to see my daughter alternate weekends. It was decided in court. I was 18 and heart broken. I wasn't able to fight logically in court. So he got custody. My daughter is now 6 and I'm 24. I'm going back to court soon for full custody.  This is after he has shown that he does not have her best interests at heart. Court is very stressful and often very expensive. It also takes months. 

Also, if you work -you will have to pay maintenance. But whatever you decide to do, make sure your time with your daughter is fun and busy. Do things with her like finger painting and reading stories. If you put her in front of the tv, sit with her and ask her what her favourite bit of the program was etc. Spending quality time with her is more valuable than anything that costs money. x </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Females don't spray like males do. Make sure you keep her in for at least 4 weeks before letting her out. {the official recommended time is six  weeks} Also make sure she is spade and has had flea and worm preventer too. For now, get a cover, like a large sheet and cover your sofa etc. Spray her with water, any time she goes near the furniture that she scratches. Give her a treat whenever she uses the litter tray and when ever she uses the scratch pad. Get her more than one  scratch post and put them in areas that she spends most of her time. If you go out, make sure she cannot get into the room with the most 'scratchy' furniture. Only let her in that room when you are there too. This will get her to think that coming in that room is a treat. Keep to that rule until she stops completely. 

You can buy cat repellent spray. Put it everywhere that she's not allowed to scratch. 

I've been a cat breeder for the last year and the above is tried and tested.  DO NOT get your cat de-clawed. It is cruel because cats use their claw for defending themselves{against other cats outside}, catching mice/ scratching behind their ears/stopping themselves from falling via the grip-e.g on a fence if they lose their balance. When your cat has been in for at least four weeks, and you start letting her out, the scratching habit will quickly die down. 

Last of all, get her toys, especially if she's a young cat. Particularly ones with dangley bits and catnip inside. You can buy cat nip spray to 'refresh' her toys with too. 

GOOD LUCK :)
