His comments were super pretentious and reeked condescension. They pretend like they don't care about what others think and yet they go on askmen and askwomen subreddits desperately waiting for someone to agree with them. why not just be honest.

Also 18 and all grown up? I hope he ends up cringing at himself later when he gets older. We all have experienced this but this guy is really doing his best to ward off any possible allies.

Oh wait, by his standard we are inferior to him so he wouldn't deem us worthy! Hurray! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> POLL: The Empire or the Stormcloaks? / Did you kill Paarthurnax? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> - EMPIRE or STORMCLOAKS?: http://vote.pollcode.com/58192785

I think it's one of few quests that kind of made me sick because of moral dilemma. I myself chose the Empire because I was introduced to TES via Oblivion and well.. it's hard not to like Patrick Stewart's empire. Still I was sympathetic to Ulfric's causes. Visiting Windhelm became painful for me after his death.

- Did you choose to kill Paarthurnax?: http://vote.pollcode.com/32576536

This one was easy for me. I didn't kill him. It seemed plain wrong to kill the dragon after he helped me murder his own brother for the good of the world :s

I'd love to hear what you chose to do, and why. </TEXT>

But what I meant by "extraneous causes" was more along the line of women -- who, according to his comment history, are nothing more than shallow liars. While there must have been some like that, I assume a whole lot more were driven away by his prejudice against women. </TEXT>

They first thought he was just a timid but nice guy who needed encouragement. Hence all the advice and gilding. And then they found his other comments. People now feel like they've been fooled and think the guy was faking innocence. 

I don't think the guy feigned anything in his first comment, but I do think he's been unable to meet women (or make friends at all, since he points out in one of the comments) for a reason attributable to himself rather than extraneous causes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't tried out extreme group compositions like 3 grave robbers, but I do love the class (as my flair denotes!) 

I usually get lunge, dagger throwing, shadow stun (it's been a while and skill names fail me), and lastly whichever skill that suits the dungeon. I've found her accuracy and dodge modifiers to be very useful, more so because she deals a significant amount of damage + crits at the same time (as opposed to the Crusader's and the Leper's skills which take up one full turn without attacking the enemies).

But her elixir and poison dart skills are far from my favourites. Wish the devs would rework those skills :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beautiful! I can just feel the despair. It's funny how "permanent" deaths of your heroes can be devastating in a game even though I'm fully aware of the fact that they're just characters in a game and even replaceable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a bit late to the post so you might have already beaten her by following other advice, but here's my two cents:

- Try to avoid trinkets that decrease the death resistance

- At least one guaranteed healer or champion with heals. Even if the skill only heals by 1 point, as long as they can get someone away from the death's door. I refrained from taking an occultist with me because of the bleeding possibility and the position swaps.

- I'd recommend taking the Vestal and the Crusader for sure. 

- Equip characters with bleeding skills and trinkets. (Highwayman and if you can level up other heroes, Hellion.)  IIRC the Hag is blight-resistant but not so much towards bleeding and those ticks can be valuable when accumulated. 

- Highwayman's point-blank shot + Grave Robber's lunge can rescue those who are tossed into the pot with minimal injury. 

- The Crusader's rush-in skill (I forget the name, the one where he dives to the front) is great for attacking the Hag in the back when partnered up with the Highwayman's point-blank shot.

The Hag bosses were the most challenging for me as well, so I wish you good luck! It's so disheartening to lose beloved heroes to a witch that cooks people in a pot :( </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about leveled items and enchantment damages </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-27 09:22:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I understood the term "leveled" as "deciding the quality of the item based on the character's level AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION". So I thought a unique sword obtained in level X would only have the damage of whatever damage that is set for level X for the rest of the game regardless of my future level ups. (Which I thought was true for Oblivion, and hence advice to postpone certain quests to get the best item.) But it seems the items level up with me. e.g. I got Molag Bal's Mace relatively early but the damage is steadily increasing with my level ups. So does the term "leveled item" actually mean their quality increases as I gain more experience?

As for damage enchantments: as I understand it elemental damages are added to the mechanical output --so if a sword can deal damage x and fire damage from enchantment is a, the total damage per swing is x+a-- whereas magicka and stamina damages attack only those qualities and not the enemies' health. Am I getting this correctly?

I went to TES wiki websites but I couldn't get straight answers. Insights appreciated!

edit: typos </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Noice! Do you have the soothing whispery voice as well? haha

I really like Skyrim's Argonian voice. IIRC Khajiits and Argonians shared the same voice actor in Oblivion and it became boring wayy too fast.

Also I have wares of suspicious origins that I need to get rid of, if you're interested. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup, definitely happened to me as well! Sometimes I postpone leveling up when I know I'm gonna fight harder mobs later in the dungeon just in case my health regen / restore potions don't do the job. But damn, 0! I don't think I've pushed to that extreme. Well done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for going through all this trouble. I was really curious about the quality of paid mods, if anything was really worth the money. Thus far I can tell there is none. (Edit: ok Akatosh one might be one exception.) 

Things like Enhanced Towns and Sounds of Skyrim, which I would gladly support the modder(s) with donations, are completely free whereas items that you documented charge people. What complete BS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've also confirmed this, but I think I'll wait a bit before celebrating lest it be premature...  Valve could not have foreseen the potential outrage when they decided to introduce it. It's doubtful they'd just get rid of it THIS quickly. I hope I'm wrong... I'm just gonna hold on to my boycotting just a little bit longer until they issue an announcement. </TEXT>
