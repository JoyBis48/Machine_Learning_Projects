	<TEXT> I worked as a swimmers aid, both the lifeguards had a thing for either my mom or me (so I guess i've technically had two). The older guy (about two hundred pounds of "doughy" skin (his words, not mine)), once invited my mom to come "put on her little bikini" and join him at open swim. 


The other lifeguard would either hit on me and ask if I wanted to leave and go bar hopping with him, or (later) ask for pics of my older sister. 

I was in middle school. He was 19. 


Yeah.

Edit; forgot to mention, when my dad was deployed to Iraq, the older guy (doughy) decided it would be a good time to tell me his stories about 'nam, and how he witnessed one guy get torn to bits by a crashing helicopter. Apparently it started raining chunks of flesh. My dad flew helicopters .-. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, seeing it work to at least some degree is really encouraging. It's a really good concept :] just doesn't always work on the mass scale  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're neither actually true socialist, the Nordic model has actually received criticism for being both too socialist, and too capitalist. They operate on a sort of hybrid of the two, sort of a middle ground. </TEXT>

Just kidding. If a city could be bipolar, Rochester would be the poster child. </TEXT>
