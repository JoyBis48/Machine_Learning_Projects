	<TEXT> The one thing I will forever recommend is a Rock n Play. It's so convenient, and is the one thing I have used the most and has been most useful. It's like a little baby hammock thing that you can rock and it makes them feel like they're being held by a person (or at least it does for my son). I've also heard amazing things about swings but we don't have one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been getting shit on at work for doing this.  My boss wants me to be a go-getter.  So despite doing all my work in an efficient and accurate manner, I'm supposed to go to other managers and ask if they need help with stuff.   When I do this they look at me like I'm crazy because they all have their own assistants to help them.

It's maddening.  My previous managers here were of the attitude that if I'm getting my work done and not screwing it up too much, whatever. </TEXT>

I couldn't even get out the 1.8 ounces that are best for baby's immune system.  Also I would only be able to BF for 6 weeks, as my company is really small and doesn't have a place for mothers to pump.  Every lactation consultant and expert I talked to said that a mother's mental health is much more important for baby than breast milk.  Turns out my baby is allergic to milk protein anyways, so he would have had to be on a food allergy formula anyways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely agree.  I have this acquaintance who is arguing with DOCTORS in the comments of a post she made with an article about how MMR vaccinations kill more than the measles itself.  Her family has had some medical problems and with things like a false-negative RSV test and other things she is very distrusting of modern medicine, and she even has an 8 month old who has to have open heart surgery soon.  And she's still refusing to vaccinate her other 2 kids and she refuses to get the booster herself.  She will instead quarantine her entire family for 6 weeks after her daughter's surgery to avoid the germs from the outside world.

It's infuriating.  That's what vaccines are for! They are needed to protect those people who CAN'T get vaccinated, like her daughter in those weeks after the surgery.

	<TEXT> Red flags:

* "He then changed his mind around 25 weeks, saying he needed me to work"

Why?? If he was making the same amount of money, what big change happened that made him realize he needed your income?  

* "He got off the phone and told me he had just locked us into a $200 a month contract for 2 years"

If he can't refuse the salespeople's schtick, he should not have any accounts in his name.  Any time he calls in to customer service they will usually try to sell him additional services.  This is a huge red flag and shows that your husband makes very poor financial decisions

* "He won’t even give me a complete break down of all our monthly expenses, to see myself if we can make staying at home work or not."

Why the fuck not?  This is the absolute biggest red flag to me as it seems to indicate he may be hiding something from you.  Maybe a spending problem, maybe something bigger like a gambling problem.  But you are an equal part in your relationship and you have a right to see what all your money is going towards.  Do you not have access to the checking account to see the list of transactions?  I would demand access first and foremost.

* " I haven’t drove my car in 3 months, only his, and he refuses to let me sell the piece of junk to cut out the insurance payment, and put some extra money in our pockets"

Is the car in your name, his name, or both? If the car isn't being driven, there's no reason to keep it around, especially with an insurance payment.  Why does he get to make all the financial calls when you are working and bringing income in?  I could *maybe* **maybe** understand if you were a SAHM and had no income, but since you are a contributor to the finances of your household, you have the right to see where your money is going.


You are not being irrational.  I would be resentful of my husband, too, if I were in your shoes.  I am also a working mom of a 3 month old and miss my son every day.  My husband works from home and while I'm jealous of him getting to be around Rhys all day, I don't resent him because he treats me like an equal partner.  Your husband is treating you like a child and it's unacceptable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband and I were addicted to this stuff. I stopped after I had chased the high so much that one new blend gave me awful panic attacks. My husband stopped after it got outlawed and our favorite smoke shop stopped selling it. I told him I would rather he smoke weed than that fake shit. He quit right as all the deaths and seizures were being reported. That shit is so scary. I barely remember anything from the months I spent smoking it.  </TEXT>

I just kept imagining my dad giving me that look because I ordered 3 enchiladas instead of 2.  So I just did without while they ate.

Thankfully my in-laws are wealthy and helped us out, but we burned through our savings and had to live on my husband's pay.  Now we're finally caught up on all our bills after me being back at work for a month and we just put our first $550 in the bank.  $6k in CC should be paid off by June (and we should have $7k in emergency fund by then).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After giving birth I'm getting back into lifting.  Before I was pregnant, my husband and I would go to the gym together after work and do SL.  Now that we have the kid it's really difficult to go to the gym together.  He's uneasy about me doing SL by myself because I'll eventually need a spotter for bench.  Deadlifts and squats are no big deal because I use a power rack.  

My question is this: 

Are there any other lifting programs that wouldn't require a spotter for any of the exercises?  I really liked the simplicity of SL and the lack of things I really hate (like lunges).  Should I just do SL with dumbbells?  Should I tell my husband "I got it" and do SL with barbells?  

The biggest obstacle here is being intimidated, socially anxious, and extremely shy.  If I have to ask for a spot from some rando I will probably throw up, so I'd prefer not to have to do that.  I know I'm a wuss and I should suck it up but I already feel like an impostor as a 240lb female and have pretty severe anxiety about that sort of thing.++


Edit: THANKS!   Will be learning roll of shame or to ditch the weights on either side if i get stuck on bench. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see it as very tricky.  As /u/namer98 said, the OT commands it.  But there is contradictory information in the NT like /u/I3lindman brought up.  Is deadly self-defense technically repaying evil for evil? Peter used it when the soldiers came to take Jesus away and he was rebuked for doing so.  However, Humans were given the right to exact the death penalty for murder ( John 19:10-11 ; Rom 13:1-4 ).  

In the OT, even a thief could be killed in self-defense. Jesus commanded his disciples to arm themselves and the only time Jesus was recorded in rebuking the use of a sword was when Peter was trying to get in the way of Christ's specific purpose to lay down His life.

Honestly, if it came down to it I would absolutely use deadly force to protect myself or my family if their lives were being threatened by someone.  I don't know if it's a sin, but I know I would go through severe mental anguish if that situation were to become a reality. </TEXT>
