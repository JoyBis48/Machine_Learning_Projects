	<TEXT> Holy crap, pre-cal and you're thirteen. THAT'S AMAZING!

But I understand the feeling. I eventually learned to not care what my parents or anyone else expected or wanted of me, but for my goal to be proud of myself. Now I hold myself to a high standard and am happy with who and where I am. I have room for improvement, but I know that, noone is telling me it. I know it's easier said than done, but I did it and it feels amazing.

*hugs* </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Tonight, I was tempted for the first time in my longest streak ever, and something changed. The feelings were between mild and strong and the demons were tempting me (metaphor), but... I didn't give in. I was strong. Usually no matter how small the temptation is, I give in.

I'm changing. ... I'm changing! Holy crap, I'm actually becoming a better person!

I never felt as if my life was changing until now. I just decided that I would be better off if I quit, and now I realize why! I'm actually changing my life.

Be strong in your journey, even when it's seemingly impossible. **You can change too.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /r/NoFap is an absolutely wonderful community. I'm currently on day 27 of my streak and feel so much more wholesome and pleasing to God. I highly suggest you check it out. I had been struggling with thinking about quitting, but this community helped me make the jump. Please check this out, it does wonders!

I would like to add that there have been times where I felt like God was always by my side and times where I couldn't *feel* Him at all. That's okay. I understand the fear; I have felt it too. That's kind of what faith is about. Believing and following through thick and thin. Don't think that He has abandoned you just because you feel more distant. It doesn't happen for a specific reason that I know of. He will always be here for you. And we're here for you too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really not bad, but I'm glad you asked because airy sound is my biggest pet peeve. When you sing, focus your sound forward. Imagine you sound is a laser beam and it shoots straight into the ridge in the front of your mouth where it goes from flat to a hill by your teeth. (I hope that made sense...) Also, picture your sound as a laser beam and not a flashlight. These things sound weird, but then can almost automatically improve your sound(: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome, we're glad to have you! My advice is 1) Keep yourself busy. If you're too busy doing something, your mind doesn't have time to make you fall. If you're feeling the urge to relapse, take a walk, call up a friend, do *something*.  2) Your body will trick you. The reason that I have relapsed before is that when you get really turned on, your body will tell your brain that you don't want to get turned off, distracted, whatever. *But that is wrong.* Whenever you feel the tiniest urge and your body is telling you how nice it is, get busy or come here to NoFap.  3) This is more of a personal idea, but I don't think cold showers are very helpful. For some people they are, but to me, the last thing I want to do is get naked and alone. If it works for you, great, but it never worked out for me personally.  4) Post or read as much as possible. This journey is so much easier when you know someone out there is rooting for your success.  5) Your relapses suck, but they make you stronger in the end. If you fall, pick yourself up and vow to make your next streak longer. The worst thing you can do for yourself is accept your failure, but then *continue* to fail.


Well, hope you enjoyed that wall of text. Good luck! Best wishes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My secret. **Keep. Busy.** I have been so busy these last few weeks I didn't even notice how much progress I've made. I should be proud of myself, but it's been so easy.

So, if you're feeling tempted, go for a walk, call up a friend, do something to take your mind off of it. When your mind tells you that you don't want to be distracted, rise above it. Be a better version of yourself everyday.

I love you guys. Stay strong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello lovelies,

I'm going to pick up some foundation tomorrow, and my favorite YouTube makeup artist switched from Colorstay, what I'm using now, to the 3-in-1 foundation. I don't really have any problems with the Colorstay, but our skin is very similar and I was considering making the switch. Have any of you tried one or both, and do you have a preference? Thanks(:

EDIT: Sorry, typo. I meant **Revlon Colorstay**. The 3-in-1 is Covergirl. My bad. </TEXT>
