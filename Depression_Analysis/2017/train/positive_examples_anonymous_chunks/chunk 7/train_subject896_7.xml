	<TEXT> I set the requirements high so it would be harder to get. Is 6 the normal level? Cause if so then I should change it to around 8. I thought of it in the point of, your so good at it, Casino's almost make a show out of you coming and everyone wants to play against you so Casino's net a lot when you come around. IDK just an idea?

He was using the Gobi Scout Rifle which, combined with JSP rounds, destroys low-life enemys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's all give a loud and proud ODST hoo-rah to out very own /u/Afterbang for being promoted to the status of moderator on /r/Halo!

Okay, so I have several notes of business to address. First off, we are very close to breaking our 200 member mark which, for me, is VERY exciting.

Second off, we need more content **PLEASE**! If you have anything ODST related to say, post, or reference, please do! Soundtrack songs, fan arts, poems and short stories, fan fics! Post it all! There is very little we will take down!

Third, Now that school has started for me, I check less often(still close to daily) but I will be trying to arrange at least 1 game night a month! Stay posted for more following once I get settled with everything.

Hopefully you all enjoy our subreddit and keep her strong!
~Mickey, Over and Out

	<TEXT> Im doing a small guns/unarmed run currently and it is just so fun. I am with NCR and I raided Cottonwood Cove to get Recompense for the Fallen which, combined with the copious amounts of Rushing Water I have made available, can kill Yao Guai's, Cazadore's, Nightstalker's, and (baby) Deathclaw's with no problem. I would put more points in your Strength and Endurance and maybe the implant for Luck and Agility. I would suggest PN(Project Nevada) cause it gives you an opportunity to get another implant called Razor Nails that raises Crit. Hit and Base Damage of Unarmed. </TEXT>

Vault 44 Columbia, MO
The only people allowed in are people with minor psychological disorders (ie. Bipolar, OCD, Depression, Schizophrenia, etc.). All "subject"s are given 4x the normal dose of their medicine through food and water. After 10 years, they are entirely dropped off the medicines and have to live another 10 years without medicine. After the 20 allotted years, the door will open.
Each room is set to bug each persons psychological disorder. So for someone with OCD, everything is offset the smallest noticeable difference but can't be moved. Schizophrenic's will have a small speaker that constantly plays a barely audible conversation. So on and so forth.
There will be 1 9mm pistol in each room with enough rounds for every person in the rooms.
**PLOT TWIST**: Similar to 101, there is an omniscient Overseer. He has no disorders, and is locked in the Overseer's office until the door opens. He cannot communicate with the people, however, he knows about their drug intake. </TEXT>
