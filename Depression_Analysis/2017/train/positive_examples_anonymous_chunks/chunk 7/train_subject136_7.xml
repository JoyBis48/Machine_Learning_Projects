	<TEXT> While I agree with you on the merits of an online MBA, I don't think it carries a separate designation on your resume.  It'd simply say "MBA from School X".  

The only other thing is that you may not have access to the same career services as the full time people, but even some of the top online MBAs are changing that and using it as another selling point for their program.

This is also why I wasn't interested in UNC's program.  Because they're spending too much time focusing on the online degree and I feel it would water down my full time degree if I was a student there.

The thing you miss out on most as someone getting an online MBA is the networking and relationships.  But if you're not switching careers then it may not be a big deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wholeheartedly agree.  I've went through something similar and eventually just learned that I will have some good days and some bad days, but life goes on.  There is no magical moment when you just up and stop feeling emotions for someone you had a deep connection with for years.  It doesn't work like that.  But you get *better*... and that's all that really matters.  Once I stopped searching for that feeling of completely being over it my life improved. </TEXT>

Some of the songs like "Walk Away" and "Fool" should easily be the backdrop for a somber scene in a movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the key thing to remember is that happiness is not something you achieve and it lasts forever.  Good times, like bad times often come and go.  So I'm still fighting the good fight.

As far as steps I've taken to combat depression:

* Exercise
* Forcing myself to get out of the house and my comfort zone
* Traveling  (helps a lot if you can afford it)
* Journaling daily. Writing a journal helps me keep things in perspective.  There are days when I thought I was having the worst day in my life and it turned out okay.

Best of luck with your battle with depression. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mainly weight gain, loss of sexual desire, and the fact that it didn't fix anything.  I had more suicidal thoughts when I was on the medication.  I would go out at night in bad neighborhoods because I had no fear of dying.


What changed it all for me was going on a weeklong cruise where I forgot my meds.  At that point I realized I didn't need them and I needed to spend more time working on the root cause of my depression.  [Which is still a work in progress btw]  But I've been off meds for at least 3 years now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having been in a similar situation, it's not looking good for the future of you two.  I don't understand why you guys are still talking and sleeping with each other if she doesn't want to be with you?

Sounds like she's just keeping you around until she makes up her mind.  There is a chance she may want to get back with you but there's also a possibility she won't.  And if she doesn't, you're going to be in some serious pain.

It seems you two need to leave each other alone for awhile and give it a legitimate break.  

Also, you're not acting like yourself.  All this begging and pleading is probably not attractive.  Sure there are some things you need to fix, but you need to do it in a manly way.  Work on yourself in the meantime but don't make it about her.  Do it for you.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I commend you in your battle.  Quick question, how do you know its SAD?  I've long suspected I suffer from the same thing but I can't tell if it's just regular depression.  What's the key differentiator?  I know gloomy weather makes everyone feel down so I'm not sure.


And yes whatever you do stay away from anti-depressants.  Worst decision I ever made that led to me quitting cold turkey against my doctor's orders.
