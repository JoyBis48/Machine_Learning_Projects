	<TEXT> Wow! Your reply made me laugh :) thanks for such a detailed response. I've got all your links open in the other tabs and I'm going to check them all out. 

Your last paragraph got me the most, it really hit home (I do have a confidence and self-esteem problem) I'm going to use it as motivation! Thanks again ♡ </TEXT>
