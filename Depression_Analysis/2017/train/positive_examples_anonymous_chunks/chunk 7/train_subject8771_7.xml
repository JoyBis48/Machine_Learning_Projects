	<TEXT> Went to BestBuy the other day, just to look around really. I went to the entertainment center and of course, what would be playing on one of the 50" screens, but a certain unnamed movie. Only one thing could be done...I turned off the TV and left.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never noticed Lin unlocking the handcuffs! Wow..that's cool. Hmm, I'd to say the whole secret tunnel thing under Sato's mansion. I couldn't help but love the connection to the TLA secret tunnel. In the same seen, when Mako and Bolin tie up the guard, I thought it was great how Bolin just nonchalantly moved his leg to earthbend to make the guard stumble over.  </TEXT>
