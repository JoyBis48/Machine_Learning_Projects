	<TEXT> I have Googled this but gotten different answers all over the place. Some say it's included in the antibiotics that affect birth control, others say it isn't.

I am using a backup form of birth control just in case either way, but now I am just curious. 

Related: I have begun skipping the placebo pills in the pack and starting the next one right away to eventually stop my period, at my doctor's suggestion (insurance wouldn't pay for Seasonique or anything like that), and now I have been bleeding lightly for 13 days. Is that normal in the beginning? I am 26 years old, 125 lbs, 5'6. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one is banning the sale of the flag. Businesses are choosing to no longer sell it. You can also fly it on your own personal property if you wish.

But it shouldn't be flown on public lands because it was used to keep black people down and spread hate and violence. Black people own that public property as much as you do. Their tax dollars shouldn't go towards keeping a symbol of their oppression flying. Would you support Germany flying the Nazi flag? It's *just like that*.

The flag was *created* as a battle flag and a rallying point for troops fighting to be allowed to keep black people as property. You're acting as though it already existed and they just used it. They created it specifically for use in the Civil War. It has no other origin or use before that. If you find pride in that have fun, but the rest of us know it was created for the sole purpose of fighting to keep other human beings as chattel. 

Do you really want your regional identity to come from the fact that you fought tooth and nail to keep others enslaved? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like to read historical fiction (I can ignore the badhistory for the sake of a good book as long as it isn't too absurd and the book is good), and I have noticed some details seem to get recycled from book to book.

For instance, I have read three novels about Empress Matilda. In every single book, her eldest son (future king Henry II) is actually the son of Matilda's rival, Stephen. Matilda's husband, Geoffrey has never a clue.

Why three different authors decided to include this bullshit, I'll never know. 

Carolly Erickson likes to make characters gay for the sake of it it seems. Most of her books are so bad I read them for the lolz. </TEXT>

ask him what he does before he leaves his house to avoid getting raped

Nothing.

Ask him what tactics he uses to keep his drink from being spiked.

None.

Ask him how many of his male friends have cried on his shoulder after being raped.

None, male or female.

Ask him which men's magazine has offered tips to escape a rapist. 

Men's magazines also don't share tips on how to avoid being assaulted in general despite men being more likely to be victims of general assault than women.

Ask him what areas/times he has identified as high-risk.

None.

Because women all have detailed answers to these questions.

I've just proven this to be BS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, you told your story. Let me tell mine.

I've had clinical depression since I was a child. I remember thinking about suicide when I was 9 years old. I was put on antidepressants when I was 10, and I've been on them for 16 years. Nothing has changed. The antidepressants take the edge off, but the misery, despair, and pain is still there as much as it ever was. 

Things change? They do sometimes. And sometimes they don't. Look at the recent suicide of Robin Williams. That man had depression for *4 decades.* It never changed for him despite years of treatment.

Suicide when one is depressed isn't selfish or childish, nor is it an easy way out. It's a response to not being able to stand the suffering anymore. Would you judge someone who suffered constant physical pain so terrible they couldn't leave the house for one day deciding they've had enough? 

Mental illnesses are the one area where people judge you for not being able to take your disease any longer. </TEXT>
