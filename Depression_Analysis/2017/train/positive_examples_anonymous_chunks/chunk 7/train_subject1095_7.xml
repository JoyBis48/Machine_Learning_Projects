	<TEXT> [Album](http://imgur.com/a/fynBk)

My local shops all seemed to run out of Divinty #1 so had that ordered. Same with The Valiant #2. I really need to remember to add items to my pull list.

Didn't realize the Ant-Man movie Prelude part 1 was already out so got me a copy.

Ordered the Auxiliary Cover for Lady Death Apocalypse #1. Always wanted to check out the series, but never felt like playing catch up. This issue really summed it up well.

Ordered Sandman Vol. 6-9, finally completeing my collection (I already had vol. 10 when a shop had a closing sale). Have five trades to binge read now.

Swamp Thing N52 Vol. 5 came in same order (which I placed 1 week before IST had a massive DC sale T.T) It is an excellent story and can't wait for vol. 6.

Last is Sandman #19. Found at a local shop when I was searching for my favorite issue (#18). It is the corrected version, but is still a very fine issue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually go a couple days between reading sessions. I'll always finish a single issue right then if I start it. I'll read a few at a time, but if I notice myself drifting off I will finish the issue I am on and take a nap (reading tends to knock me out, even comics). I have no real preference on singles vs trades. Occassionally I'll read a whole trade in one sitting, just depends on how well it sucks me in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the longer movies 10 more minutes for intermission isn't going to affect the number of showings. A 3 hour movie with 15 minutes of trailrrs and 30 minutes minimum between the ending and starting of a movie in a particular auditorium, gives you 225 minutes between start times. Say they open at 9am and close at 11pm, that gives you 14 hours to schedule as many as possible. You still only get 3 showtimes in one auditorium. 10 more minutes for an intermission per movie won't really change that. Now if it's for a two hour movie the intermission will cut into potential showtimes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder if Google Play will be having a similar sale like last year. I scored Animal Man 1-3, Swamp Thing 1-3, Teen Titans 1-3, Red Hood 1-3, Both Hawkman, JL 1 and 2, JLI 1, JLD 1-2, Batman Inc 1, DC Universe Presents 1, and I, Vampire 1 all for like $4 each. Got me started in the Comic World. If it is just a bunch of Vol. 1's I'll be a little disappointed, but a deals a deal when you still got more stuff to read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldnt be surprised if Sony gave thr Movie Chain CEOs a heads up that they were going to pull the movie before acrually announcing. Letting the initial shock/blame go to the Cinemas is a lot better than the alternative of Sony taking all the blame at onve. </TEXT>
