OMG. You are so right! What have I been thinking? Any dumbass can talk down a drug addicted parent who is raging up a storm in Child Protective Services. 

Any dumbass can hit someone with a maglight, it takes skill to get someone out of the building without hurting them or yourself. It takes skill to see the slight markers in demeanor or the trace of a weapon under clothing, remaining calm when someone is threatening you with a knife and being able to disarm and subdue them. 

Yeah, any dumbass. </TEXT>

$8.75 an hour. I am lucky I get that and 40 hours a week because some job sites pay federal minimum wage. ($7.25)

Why don't you find a better job? Motherfucker, when I get off work at 8 in the fucking morning after working 32 hours in a span of 56, it isn't exactly easy to go out and do what I need to do. 

Why don't you just stay up and get stuff done during the day? Because if I sacrifice sleep, I sacrifice my ability to do my job well, and thereby risking my literal fucking life.

	<TEXT> Are you serious? That's not a snide comment, that's a pretty realistic statement. 

~30% of Americans get a Bachelor's degree or higher. Saying that the average voter has a reading comprehension at a high school level isn't even remotely snide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But Susie down the block says I should cut out X from what ever. She would never lie to me. The Dr. just tries to push pills or diet on me. In fact, I saw on the news about how Dr's take money from prescription companies to give people their drugs. 

Why should I pay for some shill to write me a script when I can just stop eating this one thing I already don't eat?

	<TEXT> The average voter has a reading comprehension level equal to that of a high schooler at best. We've been relying on book smarts = real world smarts. 

There is a reason Obama won with speeches that are the lowest level of reading comprehension ever.

	<TEXT> I was driving home one night and passed a bus stop with some old homeless lady sitting on it. I've learned not to deal with the homeless around, because well, they tend to be the helpless homeless around downtown. I guess she wanted my attention and was calling for someone stopped at the light. Sounded so much like my demented grandma... really freaked me out. </TEXT>
