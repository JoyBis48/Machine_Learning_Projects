	<TEXT> My college roommate was picky about locking the deadbolt. He would leave for the entire summer though, and that was my time to never lock the door. My then-boyfriend needed to get something out of my place one day while I was at work, so I told him to just go over and the door will be unlocked. I get a call from him saying it's locked. I immediately freak out. I check to make sure I don't have my keys on me, maybe I had absentmindedly locked the door or something. But I don't have my keys. In a panic, I leave work and go home. Sure enough, the door is locked. I starting freaking out, thinking there's been a robbery and the culprit was kind enough to lock the door behind him/her, except the interesting thing is that the handle isn't locked (like you can do by locking it while the door is open and then closing the door behind you), but the dead bolt is locked. I text my roommate, thinking maybe he's returned from summer break a few weeks early, but he's in another state. We think maybe the dog jumped up and hit the lock by chance, but ruled that out as the dog is a 15lb Pom with bad hips. So we wait for the maintenance guy to come unlock the door. I go in expecting to walk into the scene of a burglary, but see nothing amiss. My house keys are sitting on the door-side table, where I always leave them. I ask maintenance if they'd been in that day and they say no.

To this day, I still have no idea how the deadbolt got locked, with the only set of keys that could do the deed, locked inside. </TEXT>

Dating in general is nerve-wracking, and meeting a guy off the internet can be very scary, for a million different reasons, some of which are safety related.

I once broke up with a guy I'd been seeing because he casually mentioned that he didn't think mental disorders were a thing. He told me that depressed people just needed positive thinking, and that I was "locking myself into my disorder" because I had accepted that I had it. I'm surprised I didn't punch him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll help! The Button has completely consumed my productivity at work anyway.

I'll be offline between 7 and 8pm EST, but will be on at all other times until I sleep around 2am.
