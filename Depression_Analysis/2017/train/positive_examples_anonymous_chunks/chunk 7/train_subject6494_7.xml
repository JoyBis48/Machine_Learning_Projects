	<TITLE> [Crosspost] Good Prom Foundation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-08 23:17:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As the title says, im looking for a good Prom foundation.
Skin tone: Not exactly sure, but im very pale, i would say slighty pink undertones but thats an honest guess 
Skin type: very oily and acne prone. 
Why?: Need a good coverage, long lasting, foundation thatll keep my not shiny in pictures OR real life 
Context: I normally use Revlon Photo Ready BB cream, or Bare Minerals in the lightest color, both look great in the morning at 7 am, but by 11 im super shiny and uncomfortable. i want something that i can put on, and not worry ( or worry very little) from 6pm to 5 am, 
Budget: Really any, my mother is paying, but i am going to ulta to shop so anything that would be in stock there or a drugstore would be preferable 
Makeup Experience: Moderate experience, im doing my own makeup for prom, but its not anything crazy hard. i would say i learn very quickly so i can take any advice and do my best with it 
Special considerations: Going to ulta this evening, i need it by Saturday ( so i cant order anything online)
Thanks guys! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also 15, and currently in a long term relationship with a woman. I guess you could say I found my girlfriend by pure luck, but I think letting your sexuality be known (though scary) will help attract interested people. I completely understand what you mean by practice. I think young love is something you need to experience. Just because it's "young love" doesn't make the feelings any less valid. A ton of people are being condescending on this thread, and I think it's completely unhelpful. Go out and get to know the other lesbians at you school (if any) make friendship, and see where those lead you! Good luck!  </TEXT>
