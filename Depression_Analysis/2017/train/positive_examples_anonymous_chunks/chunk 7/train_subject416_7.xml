	<TEXT> Wednesday it was a holiday here and I went sports climbing. When I came home I was so tired, I sat on my little balcony and the sun was shining in my face, this song http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTX1HJI6n0A was playing in the background and I was suddenly thinking "You know, this feels pretty good. I think I am really happy." Almost made me cry :-D </TEXT>
