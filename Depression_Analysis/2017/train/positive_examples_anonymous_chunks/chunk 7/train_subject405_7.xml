	<TEXT> Hi Im about a year sober and clean and my father is a active alcoholic who is struggling alot. I would get angry at times and disappointed but I've learned to manage and let him do his thing. You can't force him to recover but if he is willing to get sober give him the tools he needs to do that. Honestly it all comes down to what you want to do. Go home with your father and start drinking with him or go home with your father and work your recovery. I struggled in recovery because I was trying to live a normal life and try to be happy without my recovery tools. Didn't work until I started reaching out to people and going to meetings etc. Having sober people to talk to. So keep doing what your doing. Remember now that your sober you have the choice to pick up again or work your recovery. I can tell you its not going to be easy if your not fully sure on your future and recovery. I wish you the best of luck. If you have any questions let me know. </TEXT>
