	<TEXT> I'm still doing research about this, but when my OCD first started I thought it was schizophrenia. I think I was having a psychotic episode for about four years. During that period of time, I was delusional. I thought that the devil was sending demons into my thoughts to steal my soul. I thought my compulsions were ways to fight the devil. Then I realized that they were not demons </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't seek treatment until four years after my symptoms started. I initially thought it was schizophrenia, so that's why I waited so long. 

I started counseling in Fall 2013 and have been going since then. I also take medication. I think ERP therapy is the most helpful with dealing with obsessions. It is also the hardest type. 

Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will probably take some of my weaknesses to my grave. That may be sad but it is honest. I definitely cannot show how sensitive I am or when I'm hurt. Everyone has their moments when they just want to be held. Everyone has their moments when they want to be little spoon. But as man, I am expected to erase all of those sentiments from my memory. 

The world is not a good place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the bigger issue is society's definition of masculinity versus authentic masculinity. In other words, society often expects men to be unhuman. Men are real people and some of those people have illnesses. However, society has a hard time grasping the concept that men have emotional needs. 

Ultimately, mental health issues do not make a person weak and until society grasps this concept men will continue to suffer in silence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my counselors suggested a great way to do this: He gave me a phrase to help explain it to people "I'm just telling you this because I want you to know". 

Mental health is very uncomfortable to talk about for numerous reasons. However, if you phrase it that you want to let someone know about it, it makes the conversation seem more of discussion. </TEXT>
