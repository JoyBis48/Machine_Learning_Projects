	<TEXT> My next door neighbour was the best Christian in the world, She went to mass every single day. Said the rosary every single night, Always helped the priest and cleaned the church. She did this her whole life until she died of the most painful, slow, excruciating, cancerous death imaginable. When she died she left her sister, also a committed christian to live alone and run the entire farm. 2 months later her dog of 14 years died, and now my living neighbour lives alone all day praying and farming, Loneliness must be unbearable. That's when I realised if there was a God, he had been a total fucking asshole to my neighbours who were sisters. Who were both the most committed christians imaginable. Slowly killed one, and left the other alone to work for 10 years. That's when I came to the conclusion if there was a God, he wouldn't let that happen. And if there actually was a god, He's a total asshole. And that's how religion no longer became part of my life </TEXT>

In return they would leave a company bin bag (worth â‚¬5) every bin day so that we didnt have to buy one and the company would still collect our rubbish because it was in their company bag (a requirement if you wanted the company to collect it). We kept it up until somehow their boss found out about it, but it made for a funny story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 18 and just finished school. My parents left the house as they do everyday and told me to cycle to the nearest town ( 1 hour bike ride) and put apply for a job in the factory there. If I get it, which I doubt it do, I have to cycle over and back every day. They will be really pissed because they left at 10 AM and now 3 hours later I'm still lying flat on the floor aimlessly staring into a screen with no motivation to do anything. Why would anyone employ me anyway? fuck that. fuck me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished my last year of school and now all of my long time friends (8 of them) have told me to my face they don't want anything to do with me this summer and cut all ties.

 Unfortunately, I suffer from MDD and decided to cancel upcoming appointments with my Youth Therapist, scheduled during summer, because now that school is finished and exams are done, I presumed I would feel an awful lot less stressed.

My girlfiend of eight months turned out to be a cheating sleeze, and after I gave her her *third* chance, I decided even though I'm not much of a human, I deserve more. I'm not too fussed because I know things at this age (18) are only for fun and shit, and I really *really* enjoyed hanging out with her.

I'm so, *so* alone. My dad and I don't get along. At all. My upped Prozac dose no longer pulls me out of this isolated sess-pit with a history of botched suicide attempts and self-harm scars. I'm only in my first week of a 4 month summer holiday, with no promise of college (Irish university acceptance depends on a point system based on grades which arent released until September)

 I have no-one to make plans with, anything to look forward to. To be honest, no-one to live for, not even myself. I feel so alone. 


TL;DR I'm depressed and suicidal, with nothing to look forward to </TEXT>
