	<TEXT> I guess a lot of it comes down to the belief that many of  these guys have that women care less about looks, and that all you need is a good personality to get a relationship.

Which is fallacious, of course, because women are as shallow as men and the good-looking girl these guys are expecting to woo through personality alone won't come but neither will the bad-looking girl.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beauty is subjective to a point. It's been well-documented that all cultures believe facial symmetry=beauty.

You have no idea what my personality is. You're arguing at me through the perception that I fit into the 'niceguy' category; I don't because I don't blame women for my problems as I don't blame myself. It just is the way it is.

You can tell who's a FA type right off the bat and usually you nope out before they get clingy/obsessive or downright nasty.

That's what you tell yourself, then? It's more likely that you mark those you deem unattractive as FA/trp/neckbeards/niceguys and then make excuses for the character flaws of better looking men.

You're arguing from the assumption that you and other people in relationships have 'good' personalities, which is utter bullshit. The fact of the matter is that people make concessions for the flaws they find in attractive people over the flaws they find in unattractive people.

Don't fool yourself. No one gives a shit about your 'personality'; they like you because you fit into a range of attractiveness determined by society. You really think you'd be such a 'good' person if you looked as I do?  </TEXT>

So you're agreeing with me, then? That women treat me the way they do because of how I look? 

I don't lash out at women, anyway. I 'lash out' at malicious hypocrites like yourself that damn ugly men for feeling down about their lack of success with women, and force feed them these lies about personality. 

You're shallow, I'm shallow, everybody's shallow. Personality means little compared to physicality.

 Get over it and be thankful that you weren't born ugly. I'd be thankful if I hadn't been born at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I can't give examples of everyday racists in relationships, besides the casual racism of one of my friends, Mel Gibson, John Mayer, Donald Stirling ( now *he* is a good argument against the myth of personalitymoney/looks) are all notable racists who have been in many relationships, I'd assume.

This sub is for making fun of pitiful "nice guys' that think being the bare minimum for a human being entitles them to sex / reciprocated affection, and who are actually not very nice at all.

No, shithead, I was criticizing some dickhead who had called a black woman a monkey because she'd attacked a white woman. Did you even read my comments on that matter? Besides, what does it matter whether I'm racist or not? Many racists are in relationships.

You're a fool if you think ugly guys can 'overcome' their ugliness by having a stunning personality. Would you date an ugly man? Look at the sub that you're in. The entire purpose of this cystic place is to make fun of unattractive people, with the excuse that it's their 'personalities' that is the problem.

I suggest you take a look at yourself and be thankful that you received validation to uphold such delusion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whatever,man. 

You know full well why you're being upvoted, and why you used that term in relation to a topic unnecessarily turned into something about race. 

The title says, 'black women...white lady', it's been framed in the topic of race, therefore obviously changing the connotation of your comment. 

'People are monkeys', you didn't say-- you said 'Monkeys are going to be monkeys' with a clear underlying tone of who in the video you deemed to be the monkey. Or are you saying you weren't defending the girl who'd been attacked, and calling her a monkey instead for no reason? The people upvoting you know this as well, but believe that because you aren't yelling, " I hate blacks," you're not being overtly racist and they can silently confirm their own latent racist beliefs. 

 You're the racist that assumes a monkey has to be black, 

This isn't high school, you invalid. Twisting your connotations won't work on people with an inkling of common sense. Keep your poorly-hidden racism to yourself. 

You're pathetic. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-02-05 03:05:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently started with online dating and after setting up my profile, began to send off a bombardment of messages.

A couple of girls replied, one negatively ( I asked her if she liked A Serbian Film because she was Serbian) and one relatively positively. It turned out that the girl who responded favourably was into a lot of the things I liked as well. 

I figured it wouldn't hurt asking for her number, not expecting anything, and she agreed. We moved to text and I asked whether she wanted to hang out sometime in the week, to which she replied that she was busy but would let me know if she was free.

I'm not really used to interacting with women like this, so I'm wondering if it's a bad sign that she said she'd let me know instead of just straight up saying yes or no. I also don't know whether I should wait or whether I should contact her again to see what she says.

What do you guys think?

Edit: Texted her and she didn't reply. GG, I guess. </TEXT>
