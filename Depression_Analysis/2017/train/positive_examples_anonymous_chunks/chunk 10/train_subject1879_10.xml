	<TEXT> Hey, bud. I had a similar experience where I was someone (an ex that things should not have ended but they did) I had zero contact with for a year after things ended. I was in a relationship, but the interaction alone made me question everything in my life, left me unable to stop crying for days, and gave me my first real suicidal thoughts. It's been a few weeks though, and I came out on the other side. I don't really have any advice (other than to keep talking it out) but I just wanted to let you know to keep breathing and you'll make it out too, eventually. Your mind will focus on some other worry and it'll pass. Here if you need anything  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah gotcha. What I do sometimes when I'm really bad is make myself a self care checklist. So everyday I have to brush my teeth, get dressed, eat a healthy breakfast lunch dinner, do 30 minutes of any kind of body movement a day, and check to make sure my environment is cleanish. That way no matter how bad my day is, I still accomplished those (positive) things.

	<TEXT> hey! welcome. i did the same thing sort of i went to a pediatrician for really bad tension in my neck and joints that i knew was caused by depression. when she suggested i do yoga, my mom took me to a psych. 

anyway, ive had a few stints in therapy since then, and some have been great. definitely look into SOME kind of help, theres no reason you need to be suffering (at least not without trying something)

	<TEXT> hey! so it sounds like youre having cyclic thoughts, i get these too. something that has helped me (i had ones regarding death too) is everytime you realize you have these thoughts, acknowledge it. you can consciously then change the subject, and acknowledge that youre "just worrying" your brain is allowed to wander, its what it does, and recognizing that youre doing it without pulling your emotions into is helpful. hope something in this ramble helps.    </TEXT>
