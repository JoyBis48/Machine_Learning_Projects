	<TEXT> Depression sucks, and I'm really sorry you have to go through this. My first suicide attempts were when I was 12 years old. Luckily, I was sent into treatment, and I find a new love for life. It's been hard ever since because this new found love was mostly stemmed in finding people who not only related to me but actually cared. Since then, I haven't been able to make any strong relationships where I felt like I was truly cared for. But, if you can find a strong support system of friends or family, it can be life changing. But you have to remember that if you've had friends/family in the past who were not supportive of you, they will not change. I know that can be hard to hear, but you absolutely have to try to find people who will allow you to love life.

But like I said, I haven't found a good support system. I guess what keeps me going is a belief that I have a purpose. I think there is a reason I am here on Earth, and I have to do my best to see that through. I also know that life is a rollercoaster, and bad days mean that good ones must follow. I learned when I tried to kill myself that the only permanent thing in life is death. All problems can be solved in some way or another. You just need time.

Sorry if this was kind of rambly. I hope you feel better soon. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Someone Noticed </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I just want to start this with saying that I really don't even know what to write. Just thinking about this makes me feel... weird. Like I don't know how to feel about it. Like, I'm happy, but confused, I don't know. So if this sounds kind of rambly, it is. Sorry.

Anyway, I guess I'll start here; I've been going through a sort of rough patch lately. I'm about to start my senior year of high school and will soon be auditioning for collegiate musical theatre programs, and I'm fucking terrified. That plus just a general feeling of self doubt, family issues, angst, etc. has got me feeling just down. Some times I feel great while other times I break into tears because I don't like who I am.

What's really been upsetting me about all this is that no one has really noticed. I feel like I've gotten too good about masking my feelings and hiding my depression that no one can see that I feel like I'm drowning. I've literally found ways to cry in front of people without them even noticing. Even my therapist basically sent me home because I seemed fine.

But today was different. I was at a voice lesson, and my teacher sat down and asked me if I'd been scared the last few weeks. I was nothing short of shocked. I've been waiting for someone to notice something was up, and it finally happened. And it wasn't my parents, my friends, or my therapist. It was my teacher (who I must say, is probably the nicest guy in the world).

So we talked for a while, and he said a lot of really encouraging things, and I'm very grateful for that and for him. But, I have to say, I guess I'm still just shocked. People tell me *all* the time how confident I am and all that while I cry myself to sleep because I don't think I'm good enough. I've actually opened up to people about how much I doubt myself and they straight up told me that I'm confident. But, suddenly, someone finally saw me. He saw that I was struggling and that I'm not confident and that I'm fucking human. I just don't know what to say other than that. Like I said, I'm in shock. I wonder what I said or did differently in front of him that made him notice, but I also wonder if he's just the only one who cared enough to see the difference.

I guess that's all I really have to say. I'm still just baffled. I wish it wasn't so shocking for someone to really care about me, but damn it is. Feel free to leave your thoughts below. Thanks for reading this monster of a post. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like /u/ThaGivingTree said, you really can only know if a professional tells you so. For the short term though, depression (to me, at least) feels like you're trapped in a pit and no one can see that you're dying. If that resonates with you, definitely go seek some counseling. And if not, counseling wouldn't hurt anyway. </TEXT>

I am preparing my look for a musical I will be in soon, and I'm on the look out for a really solid lipstick/stain. Because I will be on stage, I need a very bright red. I also have an onstage kiss, so I'm searching for a product that will absolutely stay on my face and not his.

If you know of a good product, please let me know! Thanks so much. xoxo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like Piper as a person, but her character development has been so fun to watch. It pains me to watch her create so much pain for herself and others, but I think she's just developing into who she always was deep down. I think she's just a manipulative person who will do what it takes to "survive" (really just get what she wants and find temporary happiness). Whether or not she'll ever be able to become a decent human being who can function normally in the real world is hard to say. I'd say probably not. That's probably the last thing on her mind, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started going to therapy again recently. We talk about my relationship with my family and everything that I used to, but something is different. I think I've become too aware of what is wrong with me and what is bothering me that I'm covering it up too well. My problem is that I hate myself a lot of the time. I think I'm not good at anything and everyone would be better off if I wasn't around. I'm not suicidal like I was last time I went to therapy, but I feel like I'm suffering in total, deafening silence. Now my therapist can't even see it because I'm too afraid to open up.

I don't know what to do anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hey fam,

So I've been going through a bit of a funk lately. I'm about to enter my senior year, my sister just graduated high school, and I'm feeling kind of stuck in my circumstances. Being that summer's coming up, I'm looking for a way to kind of step out of the norm and feel a little more like myself than the person I'm supposed to be. (Yes, I am aware how angsty I sound. My apologies.)

So, how do you guys step out? How do you break the norm? How do you express yourself? I don't care if it's advice or just your own story, feel free to post below.

xoxo </TEXT>

But I'm stuck, and I'm worried that if I let this continue I'll spiral into suicidal tendencies again. I feel like those times are the only times anyone is willing to help me, but I don't want to go through that again... I want to be stronger than that. But all I need is time to talk it out. But I can't. I'm stuck in school and can't get away.

That probably was all very rambly, but I needed to get it out. Thank you for reading. Comments are recommended and appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/Christianity,

I haven't been on reddit in a long time, but I'm going through a really stressful time right now. I am going to be trying out for an officer position this Friday on my school's dance team. It's a really taxing process and it's bringing me a lot of stress and anxiety. I am hoping that I can reach out to my fellow brothers and sisters and ask that you all pray for me. My name is Nicole and my main goal is to get Captain, if that helps.

In addition, this may seem ridiculous, but I have to ask because it's gnawing at me. I've been trying to ask God for a sign to hint me toward the outcome. I've been asking for so long that sometimes I wonder if He's trying to answer me or if I'm just making it up. So, if any of you feel any inclination or experience anything that suggests I either do or do not make an officer position, I would love it if you could share. Like I said, I know it's ridiculous, but please forgive me. I'm under a lot of stress right now that I am having trouble coping with.

Thank you all so much, and God bless.

TL;DR: Please pray that I get through a very stressful tryout process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The goal of Christianity is to get as many people into Heaven as possible. As Christians, we believe that God created you and the rest of the universe out of His unselfish love. He asks simply for us to live holy lives and return His love. If you do not accept Him as your loving Father, this makes your salvation much more difficult.

Thank you for your question. I find it really beautiful that you search out the facts of religion as opposed to simply denying yourself of the opportunity to educate yourself. I would recommend you try praying. This may sound silly, but just try speaking to God. You may not believe it but plan out your thoughts in your head or aloud and simply ask Him to reveal Himself to you. He may choose to send you a sign and reveal Himself to you. This is merely a suggestion, but I hope that you might find the comfort in the love of our Lord that I and many others have. I'll pray for you.

God bless. </TEXT>
