	<TEXT> The only reason this happens is because I work 7-4 and instant oatmeal exists.  My work provides hot water and disposable coffee cups.  They also have a microwave and I have morningstar veggie sausages that I grab on the way out the door.  It also gives me an excuse to stall work for about 15 minutes while I prep and eat breakfast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL Yeah I was planning on skipping the handstand progression altogether to start out.  One thing I liked about this program vs other bodyweight programs is that it had stuff like assisted squats whereas i've seen other bodyweight programs throw you into bulgarian splits and I'm like "yeah i wouldn't be getting up off the toilet after those" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this exact routine about 6 years ago while I was on vacation from school.  The only thing that helped me was fasting as notoriousrdc said and then getting into a routine and sticking to it.

Also, **your bed is only for sleep and sex**.  Otherwise it will take you forever to actually fall asleep once you are ready to go to sleep because you've been in bed all day watching Netflix and your brain is like "so what, we've been doing this all day..."   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I've already asked around in their Moron Monday thread and they suggested modifying.  Their beginner routine already says to skip certain parts of the routine until you have mastered others.  I'm even going more basic, like doing fewer sets to start out so I don't hurt myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went to Austin for girls' weekend with my two best friends and had a blast.  Walked a ton, it was hot as balls, swam in Barton Springs, took tons of pictures. Looking at the pictures I had some pretty big realizations about my health, though.  My appetite is pretty much gone and any cravings I get are pretty much squashed by looking at those pictures. Plus I have a cruise in December to look forward to and a son who I never want to ask me "Why are you so fat??"

Also, I want to move to Austin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am an obese , full-time-working new mom (as of 9 months ago).  The training guide seems very straightforward.  I have my diet under control thanks to MFP and am eating 1550 calories/day. I don't have any equipment whatsoever.  As I progress, I will be adding to the equipment so I can get in the workouts.

I guess my question is more general fitness-related.  Recently, whenever I've tried any new workout I usually end up so sore two days later that I can't get up off the toilet or out of my chair at work without serious grandma-ing.  It hurts to walk and do everything. The DOMS are so intense that I literally cannot pick up my child to change his diaper.  I'll admit, this usually leads to me thinking "shit, I can't deal with this, I have to be able to function" and am then on the lookout for another routine.

Should I take it easy and maybe not do all the strength sets the first week?

	<TEXT> I had the same reaction to the heartbeat as you.  Wasn't emotional or anything.  "That's pretty cool!"  I also had the same fears as you regarding not loving my child.  

You may not immediately connect with your baby.  It happens, and it's no big deal.  Motherhood may suck for a while, since the first couple of months your baby eats, poops, sleeps, and cries.  How much he/she does of each depends on your baby.

If you put effort into it and make sure you take care of yourself mentally and take care of the needs of your baby you will get there.  You will probably connect with your child.  

I had a small group of 3 friends that I constantly texted with before I was married and then we kept in touch until before I was pregnant and now that my son is 9 months.... we're doing a girls weekend this weekend.  We are still the same.  They love my son, they love seeing pictures and seeing him in person and hearing about him.  We still talk and do all the normal things.  I may not have been able to see them as much as I was able to before, but that's ok.  Things change.

You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.  However, social development is important for your child and that means interacting with other children.  That may mean chatting with their mothers/fathers/guardians and being polite and listening to their conversations while your child learns to play with other children.

I'm being 100% honest with you here in saying that one aspect of being a mother is giving up some selfishness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's always the possibility if his wife gained a lot more weight over a certain period of time and other things were affected (like libido) that depression could have a lot to do with it.  A very active person suddenly get depressed, doesn't want to cook for herself, doesn't want to get up and do anything as much, and the weight is very easy to put on in that case.  I would say if his wife gained the weight recently and she's open to seeing a doctor that she go see a GP, get a full hormone and lipid panel and the doctor may ask how she's feeling emotionally and may refer her to a mental health specialist.

That's at least how it went with me. </TEXT>

Then maybe transitioning to Strong Curves.

I'm also fucking exhausted.  I admitted to my therapist last week that I have an eating disorder (BN) that has developed over the last 3 months or so, so I'm in therapy and on a medication for that which of course makes me feel even more tired.  But I can do 25-30 minutes a day to start out...

We are very progressive in our beliefs, I actually lean more towards universalism nowadays.  I want to raise him in the community of the church without the shame that I was raised with as a Southern Baptist that was always being told that sex is dirty and evil.  

I much prefer the way the Lutheran church handles it.  We had him baptized at 6 months, and when he goes through Confirmation classes around 13 years old or so he can decide for himself if he feels that he wants to continue with his spiritual journey in Christianity or if he wants to move on.  I don't want to pressure him into believing something blindly like I was pressured as a child. </TEXT>

He’ll laugh and say that he can’t sleep

And he don’t know the reason why

Maybe it’s the evil eye

Oh, that awful, evil eye

Remember how he used to hold you close

Now in the middle of the night

Oh, the evil eye

Oh, that awful, evil eye

Someone must really have it in for him

The way they’re sticking him with pins [claws]

Oh, ooh

Now we sing to our son, and replace any word possible with Rhys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am 235lbs at 5'5.  Obese.  I love weight lifting and have seen results from it in the past, but recently had a kid (ok, 9 mos ago) and am ready to get back to it.  

The book suggests I eat 11 x 235 = 2585 calories to lose weight.  I plan on doing a 3 lift week and 3 days of walking, is this still too much to eat?

Also it says to eat 1g of protein for every pound of body weight, not lean body mass.  So I have to eat 235g of protein a day?

The IIFYM calculator says to eat 1880 calories for moderate weight loss with 3 days/week of working out.  I'm just a little confused.  I figure I'll try 1880 this week and if I'm just extremely ravenous I may up it, I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been through potty training our son yet but this is from personal experience.

My #1 tip is if he's not ready and having lots of accidents, don't force him to stay in big boy underwear.  I was forced into panties at 3 years old and was terrified of having an accident, so I held in my poop (also called encopresis).  This led to painful trips to the bathroom and it was a vicious cycle that wasn't fixed until I had sheer willpower at the age of 12.  Now my mom says she should have listened to her friends and put me back in pull-ups.  They had literally tried everything, including rewards, punishments, etc... and nothing worked.

I know this isn't typical, I'm just passing on the information from my mom.   </TEXT>

We may be having a little less sex now but I feel that we are connecting more emotionally than before.  I put the less sex on me as I am still really struggling with feeling sexy and losing the baby weight.  

I was terrified he would check out because he didn't want kids to begin with but he wanted to marry me more than he wanted to remain child free.  We compromised on one, we probably won't have any more.  The first couple of months were a struggle because newborns are basically pooping, crying potatoes.  But we fought through those months together and now we have the most amazing, intelligent, curious boy and we both adore him and adore each other so much.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It helps manage cravings by reducing the amount of insulin that is secreted because there is no blood glucose.  Increasing blood glucose (whether by gluconeogensis or just eating carbohydrates) triggers insulin secretion.  If blood sugar is increased because of cortisol, insulin secretion increases, which leads to a little fluid retention.

	<TEXT> So if a person doing low-carb had an increase in cortisol from a stressful event, they could potentially be knocked out of ketosis from the rise in blood sugar from gluconeogenises, which may result in some weight gain from fluid retention that usually happens when, for example, someone doing keto has a cheat day (holy run-on sentence).  But nothing like the 50+ lbs that this guy has gained. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What does the role of cortisol play in all of this?  I've recently started a (doctor suggested) ketogenic lifestyle and have been listening to podcasts for motivation.  There is one big proponent of low carb (Jimmy Moore) who has recently packed on the pounds and claims it's all to do with not getting enough sleep and being stressed about his book deadlines.  He's also a big proponent of "calories don't matter when you're doing low-carb", whereas I think it's bullshit, that you still need to count calories even while doing low carb.  Do his excuses carry any weight? </TEXT>

Honestly my mental health couldn't have taken being off my medication along with the hard work breastfeeding is. Thankfully every medical professional and all my mom friends said that the mom's mental well being is so much more important to the baby than what it's being fed.

	<TEXT> 1. To be able to take selfies with my friends when we're together and not dread the outcome

2. To be able to raise my son to be active and healthy without coming across as a hypocrite

3. Mental health benefits.  No more self-loathing, no more bingeing (sometimes coupled with purging)

4. To be able to shop for clothes that will usually look good on me (as a thinner person) than things that will rarely look good on me (mostly shapeless things)

5. To finally be able to say I'm a normal weight as an adult.  The closest I've been was 5 months after my dad unexpectedly passed away.  I was so heavily medicated and in grief that I didn't have an appetite.  I could drink a large coke from McD's and have a double cheeseburger and be fine for the day.

6. The reactions from people who haven't seen me in a long time.  Especially people who have been exceptionally mean to me for no reason.  Mainly one of my ex-friends whose last words to me were "go get more fat, bitch" (after I asked her to buy a $99 bridesmaids dress for my wedding).  Unfortunately I did get "more fat" (i think she said that because she thought it sounded more intelligent, even though "fatter" is correct), but now I'm getting less fat </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few weeks.  To be fair we had been really good friends for like 7 years, fooled around off and on since we dated in 9th grade, then when we got back together junior year of college the feelings had already developed.

On the other side of the coin, one of my best friends has been dating a guy for 3+ years and he will not say it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It could take 15-30 minutes to get your first one done.  After that, each time you get one would probably be about 10 minutes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the love of God, get it re done at least every 6 weeks. Otherwise it'll grow back long again and hurt just as much. I go every 4 weeks and it hurts so much less when I go more often than when I let the forest grow back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm fat but shrinking (down 30 lbs and beatig a sugar addiction) and I have an 8 month old son. He mostly doesn't eat anything that wasn't killed for its meat or picked from a plant. He occasionally gets rice crackers (maybe once a week) and eats things like liver and bone broth. I'm going to work very hard to teach him how to eat and encourage him to exercise and I've realized that I am absolutely his role model for these things. If I sit around eating mcdonalds all the time but tell him he can only have vegetables and meat he is going to resent me. I'll be damned if he has to go through the same shit I did when his health is under my control </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An ex friend of mine who ended the friendship over having to buy a $99 bridesmaids dress is broke and can't keep a job. She is crazy, always trying to get people to buy her shitty art (looks like anime) and considers herself a model because she poses at art classes (not an art school) at a local museum. She also has local photographers photograph her for free and they get to keep the prints.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * He shows his physical attraction to me multiple times a day, even though i'm not big on physical affection.  Still makes me feel beautiful and loved.

* His stupid jokes crack me up

* He's such a wonderful dad

* He's so easy to talk to, though this may come from being friends with him since 7th grade

* He's *so* smart

* How protective he is of me and our son </TEXT>
