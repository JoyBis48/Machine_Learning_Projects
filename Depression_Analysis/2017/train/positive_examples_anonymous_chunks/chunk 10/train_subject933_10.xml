 How could you leave me? I thought that you needed me. When the world got too much and you pleaded with me. Who helped you immediately? How speedy of me? How could you deny me so vehemently?

	<TEXT> I think the fun sizes are really to control calories 

Not in the slightest

I would steal this one from the internet: "She's a freak, but she's classy. Pussy so good I need my wheelchair from Degrassi" _Drake

I don't like seafood

I don't like pork

Alternative Rock

Adventure Time!

I am not

That's a hard one. Probably genital herpes because no one could see it

I'd rather not discuss that online because government lololol

Definitely not extra terrestrials

I definitely think intent is enough to make a case

I think human accomplishments can have long term meaning. There have been plenty of negative decisions that have impacted people for centuries

I think we are souls

Yes, I definitely believe so. 

That's an interesting question that I've never considered before. I immediately thought about plants. I would say that any organism that is living and breathing has a soul  </TEXT>

When I was a kid, my dad told me coffee would stain my teeth. And I like my teeth, so I just never started. Even all throughout college. 

I also gave up sweets to lose weight. So I haven't had a desert (e.g. a cookie) for over two years. I know, I'm weird.  </TEXT>
