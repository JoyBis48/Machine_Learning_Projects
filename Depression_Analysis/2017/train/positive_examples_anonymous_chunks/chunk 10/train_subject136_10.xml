	<TEXT> My ex and I broke up over three years ago and initially the thought of not talking to her for a month was AGONIZING.

Fast forward, I spent numerous times breaking NC and trying to work things out over the years to no avail.

I would have a REALLY hard time staying strong when she initiated contact.  I'd say, "Well, what's the harm in engaging in conversation?"  It ultimately would lead to me being more hurt than before.

I can honestly say that now I'm finally ready to move on.  For so long I kept hoping for closure but **I realized that closure comes from within.**  There's nothing more for us to say to each other.

Previously, I would look at my NC counter nervously as it got above 20 days.  I'd dread the impending contact from her side.  Nowadays, I'm excited as the days pile up.  The momentum is great.  I say to myself, "If I can do a month, imagine how three months would feel?  Imagine how a year would feel??!?"

I'm sure a lot of you still have hope of getting back with your ex or a lot of you don't really want to never speak to them again.  I know everyone's situation is different but from my experience I can say that you're better off just sticking with NC.  I wasted 3 years going back and forth.  If I would have just stuck to my guns in the first year I'd be better off right now.

I'm proud of myself and I look forward to being even stronger and taking back control of my life.

*There is one small caveat in which I think it's okay to break NC.  If and only if the person makes it clear that they want to get back together AND it's what you want.  Any other small talk is pointless and will only set you back.*

MERRY CHRISTMAS! (if you celebrate that kinda thing)  I just wanted to share this with you guys.  Stay strong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Take it from me, don't respond.  

It only alleviates their guilt and makes THEM feel better.  Some people could see it as rude but what's the point in responding?  What will it accomplish?

The only time I think folks should respond to an ex is if they're clearly making an effort to talk about reconciliation.  Anything else is just pointless chatter that will get your hopes up and ultimately set you back.

I to have asked myself what I'd do if I got a Christmas text and I'm preparing to ignore it as well. </TEXT>

With that being said, you guys obviously have communication issues and should've discussed this way before the engagement.

	<TEXT> I've been trying to practice Stoicism for awhile but this caught me off guard.  Never in my life could I have imagined this negative scenario and prepared myself.

I've decided to come here instead of /r/BreakUps because I find working on how I view and react to the events more useful than talking about why things happened.  Because honestly, I'll never know why.

So far the best way to frame this that I can think of is that it was a blessing in disguise.  That I now no longer have to stress about how to find a job near her or how I don't have to worry about any other pressures with her.  

I'm curious to know you guys' thoughts. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A tenet of Stoicism is imagining negative future events to prepare yourself mentally for if/when they happen. (i.e. loved ones dying, etc.)

Recently I sought to put this idea into practice before going on a jog... to get my mind clear.  As I started the exercise I started imagining myself breaking my leg or getting severely injured and stopped.

I was horrified at the thought and realized that **negative visualization may not always be a good thing for the psyche.**  I couldn't see how imagining the worst case scenario was going to help me in that instant.

Could some of the more experienced Stoics chime in?  Am I thinking about this in the wrong way?  Please help.  Thanks </TEXT>

The compulsion comes from human nature.  I don't obsess over my ex or even dwell on it.  I randomly clicked a link and there I was, back in the past.  

I only shared it in case someone else can relate and to show how quickly it happens.  A lot of times people treat NC as a once you do it it's a done deal type of thing when in reality people slip up all the time. </TEXT>
