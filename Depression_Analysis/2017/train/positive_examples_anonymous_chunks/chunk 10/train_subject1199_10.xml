	<TEXT> I'm a writer/director working on a pilot that's going into principal photography in a few weeks. 

If you're in LA area, PM me, and I'll give your daughter an internship. It's for the 24, 25, and 26 of Oct and the 7, 8, and 9 or Nov. 

Nothing fancy, but you can get better information from my *actual* producers than just some random redditors, especially on r/personalfinance. </TEXT>
