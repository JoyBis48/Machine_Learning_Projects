	<TEXT> It seems like most of the 50+ yard TD's were actually underthrown and really only caught because the WR beat the DB coverage pretty badly. 

I could be being overly critical, but if your WR has a 5 yard lead on the DB, you should be able to hit him in stride on a 40 yard throw as a starting NFL quarterback. </TEXT>

But as long as you keep giving Valve money for hats, why should they care about the quality of their servers?

Well, maybe you should give it all away, start from scratch and accomplish something difficult and time-consuming that you've always wanted to work for. Then at the end of it, you can look at whatever that might be, smile, and say "I did this."

If not, the aspirin thing isn't even going to work. It's actually really difficult to commit suicide by way of the aspirin/acetaminophen type of drugs. IF it even works, it'll take a good 6-10 hours of you experiencing severe liver failure and vomiting. It's not a quick process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work at a casual restaurant for a bit right after high school, and a couple of my bros came in to chill at the bar before my shift ended.

This girl I knew who I shit you not could pass as a goddess came in to get some food. They know I was crushing on her pretty hard, and I got a bit nervous. When she came up to talk to me, after the hello's and whatnot I made the mother of all mistakes, especially with two of my friends right there.

*laughing about something* "So like, do you come here often?"

I just hear both of them burst out laughing for half a second and then try to conceal it, and the girl smiles as I'm trying to play it off and says she'd text me and left.

	<TEXT> If there is an audible change, the dj is using effects.

If there isn't, the dj is most likely setting up the song that will be mixed into the current one by getting it to the correct BPM, EQ'ing out frequencies, getting it to the part he needs to start the track at, etc. 

One thing to keep in mind is that, at least in my experiences, a dj can throw on his headphones and play both tracks, but make it so only one plays through the speakers. This allows lots of tweaking and button pressing to a track that isn't being played over the speakers to get it necessary to be mixed and transitioned into.

Or in the cases of shitty dj's, the mix is pre recorded but the dj is still required to do something to hype the crowd instead of just standing there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er... I dunno, "does what no other dildo can do until now", latest and greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques! </TEXT>

The only way I've been able to explain it is that I guess I'm somehow flexing something in my inner ear, or increasing pressure somehow, and it generates the sound of whooshing air and people just look at me like I'm stupid. Also nobody else can hear it.

Thoughts?

	<TEXT> QoP is really easy man. 

Go mid, take 2 points in shadow strike and 1 in blink at 3, then 2 in scream. Get Null and Tangos, and use Q+auto attacks to harass the enemy mid. Unless they're full health you should be able to kill them with a full combo and some auto attacks at 6. There are only a few heroes that can actually take that kind of harass, and her high damage should make cs'ing easy enough. Gank a side lane if you get a good rune.

After the laning stage I like to rush Aghs. There is a lot of fighting in this patch, and having a 40 second cd 450 nuke at level 11 is massive, especially because that's before BKBs and you should be able to land your scream for another bunch of damage. 

After that I'd usually go Scythe or BKB depending on which I needed first, and then Octarine is sick on her as well. 

Remember: she may be squishy, but her auto attacks definitely do some decent damage.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by becoming blood brothers with my best friend </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-31 23:02:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Happened last night. So my best friend lives in Denmark, I live in the US. We are both hardcore drinkers, and he is back for a visit. We got all of our best friends together for a raging party at their house with lots of alcohol and some fireworks.

It's probably around 3 AM. After an uncountable number of beers and rum and cokes, we decide it would be a good idea to becoming blood brothers, to solidify the best friendship. We went about that by taking a knife, putting a small slit in our hands, and doing our handshake. Well, he goes to cut my hand and slices a ~~8~~ 3 or 4 inch gash into the side of my hand because alcohol. Uncontrollable bleeding, it's all over the floor, you get the picture. 

20 minutes later, 6 cop cars show up outside. Apparently they were called because a neighbor mistook the fireworks for gunshots. Well, they looked inside and saw the blood, and immediately busted into the house with guns drawn putting everyone in handcuffs.

We were eventually able to talk our way out of the situation and nobody got arrested, but for a minute it was looking like we were going to be taken to jail for attempted murder. They bring paramedics, I end up going to the hospital to get 8 stitches in my hand. Worth it?

**TL;DR: Got really drunk, shot off fireworks, tried to become blood brothers with my best friend, cut way too deep, I bled everywhere, cops mistook fireworks for gunfire, busted in and almost arrested us all for attempted murder because there was blood everywhere, ended up with 8 stitches in my hand.**

**Very late edit: I confused the size of the gash with the number of stitches when typing this, it's a 3 or 4 inch gash that required 8 stitches**

**Double edit: [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/T4z6KaE.jpg) a quick picture I snapped of it last night when I changed my gauze.**  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. The problem with this in schools is the zero tolerance violence policies. It's completely stupid. 

Look at it like this. If a kid confronts you in the bathroom and threatens to beat you up for your phone or lunch money, the school teaches you to lay down like a little bitch, let yourself get beat up and robbed and tell a teacher afterwards. Yeah, the kid might get punished later, but look at it in a real world situation. If you're being mugged, are you going to just let yourself get robbed for your wallet and then tell a police officer afterwards? That'll do nothing. It's far better to teach children how to defend themselves, so that later on in life they can protect themselves against potential robbers.

My dad taught me how to fight when I was growing up. I got robbed at gunpoint by someone smaller than me about a year ago. I broke his arm, kicked the gun away, beat the living hell out of him, and robbed him back. Got around $400 out of his pocket, so I'm assuming he'd been making rounds around the dark parts of my neighborhood all night. I guarantee that person will think twice about robbing people from now on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only difference between ranked and unranked is that ranked shows your number and people generally try harder to win than just playing for fun. Your MMR will increase/decrease by around 25 for every win/loss. 

My advice in ranked? Only play heroes you are good at. Ranked isn't the place, usually, to experiment with new heroes or new builds. Having just reached level 13, I can guarantee you're not actually good at any heroes yet, but pick the ones you normally do best with. When you pick a hero you know in and out, you are able to focus more on map awareness, game situations, priority targets in teamfights, etc. That's how you improve.  </TEXT>

I think it's more of the fact that you're in the easiest division in the league. The Texans are your only threat, but you're pretty much guaranteed a playoff spot every year.

If I'm correct, I think the Colts have been in the playoffs every year except 1 for the last 15 seasons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I've noticed is that since early pushing is somewhat back into the meta, especially with the rise of Undying, Leshrac and Death Prophet, you're going to be a ton more beneficial to your team by hitting that gigantic AoE ultimate every 40 seconds than say an Orchid or early Hex that focuses more on single target pick offs. 

You don't really need an Orchid if your E/R drops multiple heroes by 700 health (most likely over half of their health pool pre 20 minutes even on carries) in a half second, and the buildup of Aghs is easier than Hex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd get very comfortable with 3 heroes per role. That's 15 you could potentially choose from in a game. You can still spam single heroes, but like other people have said, if somebody picks it first or picks a hard counter then you're shit out of luck. Having a wider hero pool will allow you to still be able to play the game, and also making you an all around better player by being able to perform every role in any situation.

My go to heroes per role are PA, QoP, Centaur, Mirana, Dazzle. You don't really need to worry about which heroes are the strongest, just whichever you're best at, in my opinion. Back in 6.83 people said PA wasn't anything against a Troll, but since PA is the safe lane carry I'm best at, I still shit on most of them that I encountered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A tempo controller is a hero that wins 1v1 fights and can create a lot of pressure around the map. The examples I listed are all heroes that can easily punish an out of position support or core whenever they want. By doing that solo pickoff, you can then translate the 5v4 advantage into pushing a tower, winning a team fight, or taking Roshan. 

Basically, in higher MMR brackets a tempo controller being hidden off the map means the enemy team should be scared of where they are because they can be solo killed. In a MMR tier such as 750, I don't think the people even know what the mini map is, so you can use this to consistently roam around the map picking off their heroes, keeping the pressure up, and giving your team the advantage.

Tempo controllers are NOT heroes like Medusa or Spectre that require a lot of time and farm to come online and have less solo kill potential, or supports like Omniknight or Dazzle that are more geared towards 5v5 teamfights to be the most effective.

If you prefer support, Lion and Lina are great at this because their high amounts of magic burst is great for solo'ing heroes as well. </TEXT>

Mate, you're well below the average skill of a player for this game. You probably play just as poorly.

At that MMR, any hero can destroy if you're more skilled than your opponents. The issue isn't the hero you're picking, the issue is that you aren't better than them. 

The easiest way to win, regardless of hero, is to outfarm them. Focus on getting 5 cs per minute throughout the game on any carry, don't take stupid fights or make stupid decisions, and watch your MMR rise by a thousand.

	<TEXT> Technically it reduces 1 armor per attack, which if maxed occurs every .95 (if that's correct) seconds. I guess that isn't terrible, considering it takes 4 hero attacks to kill it, which leaves you 5-6 of the bug on the target if they immediately start attacking it, resulting in a 5-7 armor reduction. 

I'd need some time to do the math, but since it doesn't scale, I'm pretty sure maxing Geminate does more damage over that time period than maxing Swarm. You'll get a geminate attack every 3 seconds if it's maxed. 

I think his biggest problem is stat gains.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He doesn't really need mana regen. If you're safe lane, you shouldn't need to W for last hits, plus the buff to E makes last hitting easier in general. If you do need to W often, tread switching beforehand should be fine.

Even if you did, the Aquila is more than enough to sustain you until you get your Skadi, which should come sub 20.

Also, at least in my opinion, you need the Skadi as soon as possible  because his STR/AGI gains are abysmal compared to other Agi carries. The maelstrom would just delay that further, yeah it's a nice farming tool, but again the problem is that your team needs to be ahead for that to work out. If you're behind, there's no way you could afford to get it because Weaver isn't even that great late game compared to other Agi carries. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Weaver is my favorite hero. But ever since 6.83 he's been shit to play. He can't flash farm, he can't rotate to jungle early unless you buy a MoM/HotD (something I actually haven't tried yet), he takes forever to come online, he is bad at base defense, his solo pick off potential isn't really much to write home about against anyone other than squishy supports and his late game isn't even that great. 

I was really hoping to see a strength gain increase in 6.84, but the only thing they did that benefited him was slightly buffing Geminate. His Aghs isn't good if you're playing him safelane carry, and The Swarm isn't worth more than a value point as opposed to stats, which he desperately needs because if you do manage to lock him down, he's still squishy as shit.

The build I ran in 6.83 and am continuing in 6.84 for safe lane is AquilaTreads then immediately rush a Skadi. After Skadi I go either BKB or Butterfly depending on the game situation. Rushing Linken's delays your damage items too much in this meta. Lotus Orb is kind of cool but only if you're against a team with multiple single target disables. 

It seems like the only way to play Weaver currently is to make sure the other 4 people on your team can secure you an advantage while you take forever to farm your items, because if you're losing, a Weaver definitely isn't the ideal carry to rely on to bring you back.

	<TEXT> Don't know the exact psychology, but carries are the ones that get all the big flashy items. Carries are the ones that see their names pop up on the screen for Triple Kills and Godlike Streaks. Carries, in most MMR tiers, are generally seen as "in charge" and the team leader. Carries usually do the most damage and control the game. 

Supports get commanded to buy wards all game and get reported for feeding when you go 2-10-25.

Which would you rather play?

 so what could be the reason so many people under 4k hate playing it?

Because people under 4k are stupid, think they're the best on their team automatically, and think that if the game isn't theirs to control, everyone else will shit the bed and lose. Then when they don't properly carry, they blame the supports.

TL;DR: People are stupid. </TEXT>

It's a really hard game to get GOOD at because of the learning curve. I had zero MOBA experience when I started playing Dota 2, but I was hooked instantly. You need to accept the fact that you're going to suck for a while. If that turns you off, then Dota isn't for you. However, you're going to be in games because of matchmaking with players who are usually equally as terrible, so in theory it should balance out, and you'll have the occasional games where you do really well in comparison to the nine other players in the lobby. </TEXT>

Lifestealer's Feast deals 7% of their current HP as damage at max level. At full health, that will do ~280 damage to a Pudge ON TOP OF your auto attack damage. ~260 on the next attack, ~240 on the attack after, etc. Pudge also has shit armor, and doesn't usually build items that grant him any additional armor, meaning physical attacks are barely mitigated. 

Lifestealer destroys heroes with high HP pools and low armor regardless of a Moon Shard. It's working as intended.

	<TEXT> The learning curve is extremely steep. If you have zero MOBA experience, it'll take you over a thousand game hours before you have anywhere near a grasp of what you're supposed to be doing in given situations, and another thousand before you're considered above average, assuming you keep improving over that time period.

My recommendation would be to read multiple beginner's guides when you're first starting to play. Play the "Limited Heroes" pool of heroes, as these are a grouping of heroes that are relatively low skill cap and friendlier for beginning players. Choose between three different heroes for every game. This allows you to learn a specific hero's skills and interactions easily, and allowing for more focus on in-game mechanics, map awareness and situational decisions rather than trying to focus on learning a new hero each game. 

You're going to be terrible for a long time. There's no denying it, and the only way to improve is to keep playing. Dota isn't a game you can pick up and be good within a week of playing it. Every "I probably shouldn't have done that" moment is a learning experience. You will make tons of mistakes. You will die tons of times. If this discourages you, Dota is not the game for you. There isn't some magical recipe to suddenly being godly. The only way to improve is to keep playing, keep reading guides, and keep learning the game.

What I've found to be the best build is Aquila, Treads, then rush a Skadi. Weaver can't flash farm and he desperately needs the stats early on if he plans to compete at all with the hyperfast farming carries (Troll, Jug, Sniper) of 6.83. I max W/E and take 1 in Q, skill the rest in stats and take ult 6/11/16. After Skadi go Butterfly if you feel like you can still farm effectively, or BKB beforehand if you need to enter fights. After that it's pretty much up to you. MKB/Daedalus would be my recommendation.

Also this is for safe lane Weaver and will probably carry over into 6.84 without much change, although a Lotus Orb could be pretty nice in there somewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If you're gonig to be harrased, always get a stout shield and consider PMS as an upgrade.

It depends on the type of harassment. If the harassment is coming from physical attacks, then yes stout/RoP/PMS is the way to go. However, if you're going to be taking mostly magical damage (from spells) it's better to forgo those items for extra regen instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw a video where he placed Stone behind enemy, pulled, kicked back, rolled in, ulted. It's how I was practicing in bot games to learn the hero. Tried it out in a 3k game and it worked a bit, unfortunately our Troll and Sniper were god awful and even though I got some solo kills and counter ganked pretty well we ended up losing pretty hard.

Is that combo good or bad? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably a couple weeks ago when I was solo'ing the second Rosh as Troll while the rest of my team was fighting 4v5 mid lane. I was so focused on getting to the fight as soon as possible to shift the fight in our favor as a Troll with two lives that as soon as Rosh died I Phase Boots'd my hardest to get there, ran in like Rambo and unleashed everything I had.

Unfortunately, it was at that point that I died. And died, as I realized after computing for a few seconds why I wasn't respawning with Aegis, without ever actually picking up the Aegis from Roshan's lifeless corpse.

	<TEXT> Blink Dagger will now become more core than Force Staff on OD. I've mentioned this before, but this patch essentially solidifies it.

Think about it. Blink+Aghs. There's three heroes clumped up, blink right in, aghs ult them, imprison them, allow the rest of your team to get into position, and then wreck them. Perfect setup for a vacuum+wall, ravage, supernova, chronosphere, axe call, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  4x = 0 cooldown for long cooldown ultimates.

I don't think it would work like that. If you had a 100 second cooldown, the first Orb would take 25% of that away. Now you're at 75 seconds. I believe the next Orb would take 25% of the reduced cooldown away (25% off of 75 seconds, not 100) leaving you at 56.25 seconds. Another 2 orbs would leave you around 31 seconds cooldown. </TEXT>
