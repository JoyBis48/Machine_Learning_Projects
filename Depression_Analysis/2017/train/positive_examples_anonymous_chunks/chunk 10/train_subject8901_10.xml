	<TEXT> Its hard when no one understands your illness and think that you're only weak, i usually just keep my feelings to myself and wait for it to pass.

I usually am all over the spectrum of joy, depression and anger, just need someone to talk to that understands this feelings of dread and hopelessness, of feeling alone and falling into a dark hole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I play videogames for hours, it calms me down and soothes my mind.

Used to drink but that just made it worse, whatever you do don't turn to alcohol, the first times you feel good but eventually it drags you to a deeper hole.

I'm not the right person to say it at the moment since I'm going through a very rough spot in life, but try and hang in there. Cry if you must, write your feelings out and burn the paper, please, just try and hang in there </TEXT>

Que f√°cil es echarle la culpa al gobierno de nuestros problemas y nosotros seguir igual </TEXT>
