	<TEXT> Its more than that. Greece has a very corrupt system when it comes to paying taxes. Like if I made 100k euro I could pay he tax man x euro to say my income was 25k. This corruption was systemic, it wasn't a lack of work, it was a lack of responsibility. 

Combine that with austerity measures, government officials make less, thus increasing corruption, and reducing tax revenue. </TEXT>
