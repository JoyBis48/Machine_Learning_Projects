It is not exactly a big deal, but a huge sigh of relief to get confirmation that the movie is on the right track.

Either way I highly suggest picking up a volume or two of Sandman. Few rarely regret it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shadowman and Bloodshot are both part of Valiant. The comics got rebooted from the 90s a couple years ago. Since they are all pretty fresh it is easier to play catch up on. From the looks of it you would probably like The Death-Defying Dr. Mirage and Quantum and Woody, but really most Valiant titles are pretty spot on. Today Valiant actually released the trade for their 4 part series called The Valiant, in which Bloodshot plays a main role.

Now for other classics check out the other comments is this thread, but a personal favorite of mine is Vertigo's Sandman.

Comic can get expensive and a good place to find trades on the cheap is instocktrades.com.

Also check out your local Library! </TEXT>

I'm thinking she is gonna just decide to upset the balance further, I mean if the Book can get rid of a spell by God, what else can it do? Hell on Earth? Sap all magic from everyone else? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the Mark got zapped up into the sky after leaving Dean. When then see the same zaps hitting the earth where the Darkness escapes from.

Not to mention the Mark was said to be both a lock and a key, so I figure it is gone until being recast. 

Rowenna probably just used her time to read other parts of the book to power up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Didn't realize the decay was partly due to his immense power. 

Season 11: God reveals himself by saving Sam and Dean from getting swallowed by the Darkness wave, since they are the true vessels for Lucifer and Michael (God needs them to defeat the Darkness again of course) who both get let out (Due to the huge potential power of the Book of the Damned) and end up using Sam and Dean as their all too willing hosts. All of them go through the whole season in typical hunter, monster of the week, fashion fighting the Darkness. </TEXT>

I was reading up on him and when did it get revealed he was God? I don't recall that, just him being a Prophet.

Was Calliope in *Fan Fiction* really going to try to devour God? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well an article posted elsewhere in the comics is saying that they are offering full returnability for the issues on top of a big discount. Also the following issues are going 1:10 instead of 1:25. I would think selling the Geomancer at a high price (40$ like midtown?) Might help recoop the costs some while waiting to return un bought issues. </TEXT>
