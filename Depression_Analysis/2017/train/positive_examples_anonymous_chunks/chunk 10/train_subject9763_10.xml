	<TEXT> I also say try not to understand all the time, I have 'clarity days' where I'm open and I will listen to people suggestions and good things that have happened. 

When I'm down and beating myself up, there's nothing I want more than a 'yeah you are going through a really shit time' if they try and tell me how to feel better or good things that have happened I feel like they aren't listening and get frustrated and angry. Sometimes I just need someone to acknowledge that what I'm going through and what I'm saying is shit, but they are there regardless of the shitness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, just knowing someone is there but not expecting anything of me, makes me feel safe. I get scared of being on my own because I can be so dark but I struggle with basic interaction at times so there's nothing better than someone knowing you need them but not expecting anything of you other than your presence  </TEXT>
