	<TEXT> [Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I hate my mother. I hate the way she walks, talks, etc. I hate the way she constantly picks on me when I have friends around. I hate the fact that she always talks about me and my sister as if I'm, less than. "Oh, well, at least I've got another one." I hate the way the house has NO pictures of me. I hate the way she makes me run around like a slave for her. I hate the fact that she left for 11 fucking years and expected to just have a fine relationship with me afterwards, and I hate my mother.

	<TEXT> Ex-boyfriend and current best friend. He has depression just as bad as mine and tried to kill himself. When he came back, he put us on a "break". Everything got so overwhelming without him and I tried to take my own life (not just because of him, I have a lot going on without him even around) then, he tried because he thought I was dead... He told everyone "If she kills herself, I'll kill myself, cause I don't wanna live in a world without her". It's all my fault, basically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I already *had* the best time of my life, and now he's gone, it's said and done. I tried to kill myself (and failed, obviously) just to escape the inevitable downward spiral. Now, I'm just a girl with "psychotic depression" and an extremely pessimistic attitude. The pils? Make me feel like a zombie. I'm empty inside and I just want to die. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Got discharged from mental hospital today... Where do I go from here? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-12 01:10:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 13. I have to say, being in there *sucked*. I learned a little, and gained a lot of fear of ever having to return. I was admitted after trying to slit my wrists due to severe depression and stress after my bestfriend/boyfriend tried to kill himself, only to come back and put us on a "break", my mom hating me, grades dropping, etc. I was officially diagnosed with psychotic depression. The doctors gave me abilify, zoloft, and trazodone for sleep. 

My question is, where do I go from here? I've kind of decided that bestfriend/boyfriend is a trigger for me, but I don't know what to do about it, since we're so close. I also just want to make changes, become a *new* and improved me. </TEXT>
