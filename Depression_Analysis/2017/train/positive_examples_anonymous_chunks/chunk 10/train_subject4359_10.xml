	<TEXT> It's very weird isn't it? I feel more comfortable talking about my depression to people I don't know that well rather than my close friends and family. It's almost like they can't believe I'm depressed. My mom always tried to have me quit taking meds but she saw how much it helped me function after I forgot to pick up a prescription for the week and broke down completely.

Since you've just opened up to them, they must be getting used to the fact now. Give them some time, and perhaps they'll come around and see how much this is affecting you and that you need them by your side.

In the mean time you can always talk to us! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pulled myself up from feeling like that all the time, but there was one friend that really made me feel inferior. She was pretty, kind, all around "people person". She also comes from a well-off family so she would casually buy designer goods that she clearly did not pay for. I felt bad whenever I felt jealous because she was a genuinely nice person, and it's not her fault that her parents are liberal with their money.

Anyways we went from being best friends to just acquaintances and then I stopped talking to her all together because she reminded me of all things that I couldn't have. What I had could be acquired through effort; what she had was just innate. I couldn't work towards that.

I actually admitted to this via email and explained to her how I felt, how sorry I was that I just stopped talking to her even though she was always very nice. She appreciated it and revealed to me that she was jealous of my academic success (what little there was anyway) and her parents would always compare her to me. That exactly didn't make me feel better but at least let me see she wasn't living the perfect life I thought she had.

I'm still envious of people who are beautiful and sociable but I try to remind myself not all of us can be like that. It's difficult to stick to this, but I try. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, from what I've experienced and heard from my physician the clinically depressed can't really function well the entire day. You know one of those bad days you get? That goes on to become a week, month, year, etc.

You are still young and I'm glad to hear apart from acute episodes of feeling low you can go about your day most of the time. Keep it up! I wouldn't say you are clinically depressed just yet. But do consult a doctor if the episodes last longer or become more frequent.

Also I should mention that it's very natural to feel that way during that phase of your life. Talk to your friends, or us (we'll always be here!) whenever you're feeling low. You don't have to talk about how you feel, what happened, if you don't want to. Sometimes it's nice to just talk, y'know?

Anyways these are my two cents. Hope this provided some insight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry your parents didn't respond well. I feel most of the times that is the case :( I guess it's hard for especially parents to just accept that their children are having this type of difficulty, because they might think there were at fault for their children's depression (which might be true in some cases).

I hope she eventually comes to see that just acknowledging that you are going through this can provide some solace.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kudos. I've felt similar pressure when I was your age. Am a girl so no one was hazing me for not banging a random dude, but I felt like I needed it for social validation. Silly, I know, but I was young.

I'm so glad my first time wasn't some mistake because when it happened with the right guy I had no regrets and it was wonderful. I'm sure this is the same for guys as well. You want the type of first time that makes you smile when you look back on it, not cringe or facepalm haha.

Good on you for sticking to your principle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eloquently put. I guess it goes both ways; I can't understand why they feel so persecuted (oh the irony) for their belief, why they think they're being attacked. I spent my adolescence in a catholic high school and we accepted pretty much all kinds of sexual orientation. People would openly come out and no one, including the pastor, would try to change it. I wish I could let them see it's not a compromise that would break down their whole belief system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I doubt OP in the thread would see this, but I've dated guys who were shorter than me and in those cases there were always a turning point for me. At first I was just good friends with them and then I suddenly started seeing them as bf material. One was a romantic poet sort of guy, and the other protected me from a stalker. That kind of turning points.

I hope girls eventually give this a guy a chance. You never know how things will turn out. </TEXT>

I didn't realize calling them Asian would be deemed an act of political correctness.

	<TEXT> He also reminds me of Jack Gleeson, who was pretty much hazed by every person he came in contact with in public. I guess in his case it just showed how terrific he was at acting the part of Joffrey but I can see that tearing him down until he became sick and tired of being recognized everywhere. It's funny how some people want to act for glamour and others just want to act and be left alone otherwise.  </TEXT>
