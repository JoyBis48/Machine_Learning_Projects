	<TEXT> The only reason we don't have cures for diseases like Parkinsons, cancer and Multiple Sclerosis is because  pharmaceutical corporations will lose trillions so they block the research. Like what happened to Royal Rife in the 1930s, his lab was burnt down, his work ridiculed and someone attempted murder on his life, because his camcer cure - dichloracetate -is so cheap to produce it would ruin pharma corps.

	<TITLE> I'm a second year student starting a summer job as a healthcare assistant, Any tips? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-22 23:17:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi folks, I am a 19 year old male student nurse and I've completed my first of four years as a nursing student. Here in Ireland I'm qualified to work as a healthcare assistant, and I'm starting a summer job as one in a local nursing/care home. Is there any advice you can give to me as a young and relatively inexperienced carer, that would benefit me and the other staff there. I'm really looking for tips that will help me integrate with the rest of the care and nursing staff and prove that I'm competent and useful. I'm confident in my clinical skills and bedside manner. I want the other nurses to react well to me, and not think something like 'Oh no, im on the same shift as him, looks like extra work for me' or 'he knows nothing'

I'm also quite aware that the rest of the staff will be older than me, and I'm anxious that perhaps they will not take to me as kindly as someone who would have a lot more experience.

As you can tell I am quite nervous about starting. In my previous roles on placement as a student I've performed very well at the point of care and proved myself as an interested learner with good skills. Now as I shift from a student to the working world, I want to know what should the new guy look out for, and what to and not to do. 

TL;DR Student just got a summer job as a healthcare assistant, how can I be effective.

Thanks r/nursing I look forward to your feedback and help :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I recently installed a couple of texture packs to try them out, I then uninstalled them and kept Ozhara's Grand Texture Pack V2. However there are still some textures left over; Specifically the bridge and the chopped tree texture. These are still coming up as the texture from Ozhara's Space Pack, how can I change them so that I am only using one texture pack and not an ugly hybrid? Thanks.
EDIT: I am using the Steam Version </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been subbed here for over a year and have decided I finally want to step up to challenge of being a T owner. I've been looking at a Grammostola Rosea but the thing is the slings are €3.50 and the adults are €25.00 so I'm wondering would it be better to get the sling? Thanks in advance guys </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So after my sister threw a house party for her 21st birthday; I come home the day after to find that a 2 litre bottle of cheap cider still had half its contents. Satisfied with the prospect of some free alcohol, I decided to put away my prize for staying out of the house. 

Tonight I decided to get buzzed watching TV and retrieved the bottle of cider from the press. I sipped through two pints of the cider, finishing the bottle, and had some fun watching Drifters and The Big Bang Theory in the process. My dad came in mid way through my second pint and asked my what I was drinking. Surprised with my reply, my dad said to me "I seen that too but I didn't touch it, Would you not think of how every other drink in the house is gone except that plastic bottle of cider? I thought someone pissed in it"

Horror struck. I sat upright, eyes darting around the room. I noticed how the cider was semi-flat. The salty taste on my lips. The lighter-than-usual colour. It couldn't be. 

Immediately I texted my sister with my concerns. No reply. My sister is currently driving home from college for the weekend. She will home in about half an hour. Reddit this is happening right now. The salty taste on my lips worries me more and more.

The answer, paranoia or piss, will soon arrive in my driveway.

TLDR: Found some strange tasting cider after a party, Currently waiting for my sister to get home to tell me if someone pissed in it.

EDIT: Yes I live with my parents, I'm 18 in my first year of college. The legal age for drinking is 18 here. 21 is still celebrated for some reason. </TEXT>
