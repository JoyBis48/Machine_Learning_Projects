	<TEXT> I'm sitting here at college orientation, and we're scheduling tomorrow. I'm very nervous, mainly because it's my future I'm beginning to decide on (I know I always have the option to change it). Being an actuary has always appealed to me, but I've got so many concerns, and I was wondering if you had any thoughts on them. Will I have time for a family? A social life? Will this take over my life?

Edit: does anyone have any actual advice? </TEXT>
