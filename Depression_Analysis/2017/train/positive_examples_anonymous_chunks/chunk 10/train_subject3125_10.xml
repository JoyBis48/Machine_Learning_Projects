	<TEXT> I'm 17 and I suffer from sever social anxiety and depression. I  don't have the best school attendance, last week was on of my worst weeks, the house I lived in all my life was sold and I spent my week being in it for the last time, I had to send my dog to a foster home for 6 months due to the moving and other complication with the move. I've been having panic attacks all week. Yet my school, who knows what's going on and with slips from my psychiatrist they chose to fine me for truancy and suspend my drivers license for 6 months to top it all off. It feels like all they care about is a good record and not the student at all and honestly this some whit pushed me over the edge and I have been having scary thought for the past 3 days now but the only reason I don't off myself is because it would be selfish. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since I was 11 I was diagnosed with sever depression and social anxiety, my life's pretty much a roller coaster with major ups and downs. And I only have one real friend and she happens to be someone I love more than anything in the world, she knows I am in pain but I have recently found out she is really hurting bad inside, and it tears me up inside knowing how she feels and what she's going through, there is nothing I can do to make her not hurt and that just destroys me. I'm a very selfless person and I always put others first but no matter what she will always be first even though we are just friends and always will be I will always love her, and it makes me feel so sad and hopeless that I can't help at all, that I can't take her pain away , if I could take her sadness and add it to mine I would in a heart beat just to know she's happy. </TEXT>

   My cousin is adopted and before he was adopted my aunt and uncle had a daughter, she passed away, 2 weeks out of the hospital from being sick. 
  
   So my cousin Ty was around 3 and he's never learned about his sister who passed away. (my aunt and uncle were waiting till he got old to tell him)so they are driving and my aunt said she saw Ty playing with a toy in his car seat but she still asked "what do you have there?"
Ty replied "an elephant, baby Ciera gave it to me" (that was my cousin who passed away).
   But all of her stuff was in the attic where Ty couldn't have gone there by himself.   </TEXT>
