	<TEXT> To all those saying the house is shit (read to the end):

Propelling a piece of straw at a palm tree at a distance of 50cm at 320mph (the world record for recorded wind speed at ground level), the straw only managed to penetrate the tree a quarter of an inch. Even firing at the tree while it was bent (to increase the size of the pores in the surface of the tree) at point blank range added no additional distance into the tree. A piece of reed was tested as the sturdiest organic object that might be mistaken for a piece of straw. At both ranges, the reed only managed to go about two inches into the tree. Additionally, Jamie tried a piece of piano wire, and at 50 cm, it flew not only through the tree but through a sheet of plywood on the wall behind it, partially embedding itself into the cement wall.

Make the noodles, strain out most of the water. Then stir in about half of the seasoning packet and toss it with a bunch of lemon pepper. Set it aside.

Cook a can of cream of chicken soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles to your preferred level of soupiness.

Enjoy.

The whole thing costs like a dollar, and takes 15 minutes tops. And it's so delicious." </TEXT>

 I believe hatred gets humanity nowhere.

I agree with this sentiment, but I want to know your thoughts on the obesity epidemic in the States and what it means for the future of humanity. Obviously FPH's goal was not to motivate people to lose weight, but there have been many personal accounts of individuals claiming that FPH was the final kick in the ass they needed to make better lifestyle choices. How do you respond to this?

As far as all of the accusations being made against FPH, I can't think of a single instance to support them. Yes, we're a community of assholes, but that doesn't stop being true when we're offline.

Unfortunately we seem to be in an age where people want to change the world if something hurts their feelings. What happened to people putting on their big boy pants and getting over it?

	<TEXT> This was reiterated in February of this year.

[âWe will not ban questionable subreddits,â Redditâs CEO, Yishan Wong, wrote in the aftermath of that catastrophe [The Fappening]. âYou choose what to post. You choose what to read. You choose what kind of subreddit to create and what kind of rules you will enforce. We will try not to interfere â not because we donât care, but because we care that you make your choices between right and wrong.â
That echoed Redditâs official line on the Violentacrez scandal in 2012: âWe stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits.â](http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2015/02/20/how-the-reddit-exodus-illustrates-the-state-of-free-speech-on-the-web.html) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats to you and your team on a great run! I hope I can work up to a hardcore 15 miles one day.

Fatties will never know that overwhelming, full-body, amazing feeling of having just finished an awesome run or workout, as well as the energy and motivation it gives you for the rest of the day. It's better than any food. Their loss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to ride competitively in high school (time trials), but haven't been on one in years. That might have to change soon haha. Plus, you can go much farther on a bike. Better scenery 15 miles out, than the few miles around town that I run. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for joining in the chaos and posting an inappropriate picture here. I'll take it down, if you guys haven't already. It's just that I've just lost my reddit home and don't know where to go :(

Thanks for the words of support though. It's really been astounding to see just how much support we're getting from the other subs, even the ones who didn't like FPH at all. Lots of respect to those who are making this purely about the censorship. </TEXT>
