	<TEXT> I've had a therapist since middle school, who I see on a weekly basis. I first got her to work through self harm and depression. And lately we've been working through anxiety. I've known her for so long, would it be strange to try and work through this with her? The mental aspect I mean  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think I have vaginismus. I've never been able to insert a tampon, and have never been penetrated, through sex or masturbation. What's different is that I have a mental reaction to thinking about penetration. When trying to insert a tampon, I get nauseous and sweaty before I can get even a quarter of an inch in. The idea of fingers or toys make me dizzy and sick. The idea of a penis penetrating me doesn't scare me, but I'm almost positive it wouldn't be a pleasurable experience. I've had a girlfriend for two years, and on a few occasions we have tried to use fingers. Sometimes if I'm distracted during sex, she can get a tiny bit of her finger in, but once I realize what's happening I immediately start crying and shaking. I simply cannot control my emotional/mental reaction. So I guess my question is what's happening to me?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But whose to say it isn't worth it to keep him in her life? A pedophile is not always a criminal (and in this case he is not) nor does he have any intentions on becoming one (that we know of). Yes, he needs help, but she doesn't have to get out of the relationship. Just because he has these thoughts doesn't make him any less of a human being. Like any other person, he has feelings. Just because he considers himself a pedophile, doesn't mean we can dehumanize him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no problem with having a strong opinion about something, but you have an extreme bias towards this topic, and I don't think it's fair to want everyone else to condemn pedophilia the way you do. They're real people, and plenty of pedophiles do not want to act on their feelings. Should we condemn them instead of giving them help just because there's something wrong? In prison, many activities are in place to rehabilitate criminals. The same applies here. Shunning pedophiles will not help prevent child abuse, but doing research and finding ways to treat and even cure them can.  </TEXT>

This was my first indie purchase, so I'm not really sure if it should have come by now.  I messaged Shiro about it, but I was hoping to get more immediate answers of what might've happened from reddit. Besides contacting Shiro, what should I do?



UPDATE:  she messaged back and we got everything figured out. And you guys were right! She is so incredibly sweet!  </TEXT>
