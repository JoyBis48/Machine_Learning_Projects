	<TEXT> There are plenty of videos out there celebrating the ups and downs of Fatherhood too. I'm sure there'll be plenty more when it's Fathers Day. This video however an advertisement by a card company-reminding people of Mothers Day so you'll buy their Mothers Day cards. This video is not sexist in the slightest towards men. It's just talking about Mothers in particular. Are you a parent? You compared Motherhood to being an on call doctor. A doctor gets paid. The UK and US have laws and have to allow breaks, booked holiday time etc. Being a Mum doesn't allow for that. On call.  When children are content and safe, Mothers are usually cleaning, not sitting on their arses reading a book-unless it's a kids book and there's a kid on their lap.  Most Mums do not get enough sleep, due to doing more house work/working from home or dealing with nightmares and nappy changing.  Most Mum's do not expect Dad to get home from work and muck in a whole 50% because Dad's been working too. At least he got breaks and was able to eat his lunch in peace. Regardless this video was created with Mothers Day in mind. -Not a men's rights activist/everything MUST be pc do gooder.

	<TEXT> Not sure if you're male or female, but either way there is a solution. Wear trousers that are the same colour as the tan. This will camouflage all tan stains and also, people will think you're naked from the waist down, at first glance. Always a conversation starter. especially if you're hot!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It interesting to see how times have changed. White skin and rosy cheeks used to be considered healthy, glowing skin. Now the media tells us to top up our tans' for that healthy glow. Obviously sun tanned skin is a sign of sun damage not a healthy glow! However it seems that porcelain skin is making a come back as celebrities are throwing away the bottles of St Tropez. It's so damn easy to walk in to a Boots store and pick up a tan in a bottle that we're now finding that we're bored of it, as a society. Now we want a change. Bring back REAL healthy skin!!!

	<TEXT> Ex dancer/pole dancer from England. I never did this myself as I prefer my pale skin but the other girls would use fake tan{whole body}. They said it looks good under low light and helps to cover some blemishes. Also conditioner was recommended for shaving, but I find using nothing but moisturiser and a razor works best. Rub in the left over moisturiser to help relieve any razor rash you may get. Don't use scented ones though. Also If shaving whilst in the bath/shower, use luke-warm water instead of hot water. You should also use the same for hair washing.  If you get any spots, try using strong tooth paste instead of Oxy or whatever{on your face not the kitty!} If you're looking to work the. .  . kitty, make sure you shave a good few hours prior to said action. This helps any inflammation go down before the potential friction starts. Use a mirror. It sounds simple, but if you can't see what you're doing and you're after a close shave, you're more likely to cut yourself if you are blind. Hope that helps :)

	<TEXT> My daughter believes that you have to love someone very much to make a baby. You have to have lots and lots of cuddles. When you've had enough cuddles to make a baby, one starts growing out of all the love inside the lady's tummy. A baby is the start of a new family so only people that aren't related can make one. My partner and I are trying for a child currently and she's always telling us to cuddle each other to make one because she wants a baby sister. She is 7. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Has anyone tried the 'restricted' approach?  If you go to your 'friend's' profile and click the friendship tab, you'll get a list of lists. Basically,  you can put your friends in to groups. Family/Acquaintances/Restricted etc. Each group can be modified so you can stop groups seeing parts of your profile and posts. The Restricted group's default setting is to allow the group to only see the same amount as they would if you weren't friends. Excellent for work colleagues! Oh and no one notices unless they actually try to be nosy whores and go through your photos or whatever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> England here. I have a 6 year old daughter and due to an on going custody battle, social services are involved.{asked by the courts to see if residence should be swapped, not because she's at risk of serious harm}  MY six year old told them that she gets in to bed with me for cuddles in the morning when she told them I was naked I got in to heaps of trouble. I'm her Mum. I've been told that she must not see me naked at all. Not really sure what was so wrong about it. I'm surprised at how difficult it is to do this. We used to shower and get dressed together because it's more efficient in the mornings. Now we have to do things separately which she doesn't like. It's made trips to the swimming pool a whole lot harder too.  </TEXT>
