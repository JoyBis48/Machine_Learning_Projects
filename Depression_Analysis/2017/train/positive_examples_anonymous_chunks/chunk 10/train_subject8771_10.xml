	<TEXT> One of the reasons juicing hasn't worked for you in the past is because it's not a balanced diet and not sustainable. You have to ease into weight loss and it sounds like you just stopped everything and started juicing. That is a shock to your body. Creating a healthy balanced diet is the only proven way to lose weight in the long term. Also, it helps to have one cheat food. For me it's dark chocolate and I give myself an ounce a day. It significantly cuts down the cravings.  Good luck with everything.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I quit swimming my freshman year of HS (it's been 5 years), but recently I've been wanting to get back in shape. I was a decent swimmer when I was competitive, so it hasn't taken too long for me to get back to where I was. I got in the pool 4 weeks ago, and I've been swimming 4 times/week and today I swam 2200 yards (in sets), and timed a 30sec 50 (without a start). Feels good man!  </TEXT>
