	<TEXT> Such a great response, thanks! i relate to a lot of that. Actually I always imagined when I get my own house some day, I'll have a huge fish tank. Totally agree with you, fish are so relaxing. I'd love to get some now but I can't see my parents being happy about that since I live with them. I'm starting a big transformation on my bedroom and hopefully I'll have a little room when I'm done for something like that? :D

I'd hire you, if I had a pet shop.  </TEXT>
