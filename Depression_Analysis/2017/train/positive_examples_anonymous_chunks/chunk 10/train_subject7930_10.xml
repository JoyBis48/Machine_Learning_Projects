	<TEXT> Same happened and I had the game drop completely as if it never existed after trying to get into with the 'firewall bug'. Thankfully it was ARAM, but since then I've tried to play and the game keeps randomly failing to register mouse clicks and keystrokes for seconds at a time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just happened to me too around the same time and less than a minute into an ARAM. Couldn't reconnect due to a 'firewall issue'. Log in again and the game has disappeared as if it never existed. :\ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are literally living my dream. I'm about to start my second year of law school and am still trying to edge my way into the video game industry. What sort of interning experience does a video game attorney have while in school? Is this what you expected to do when you were still studying? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back when I worked at a lab, we used to splash a bit of listerine on donated human cadavers while they were thawing to make them smell a little more bearable for surgeons in training. Whenever I smell listerine now, I associate it with corpses and feel sick.
