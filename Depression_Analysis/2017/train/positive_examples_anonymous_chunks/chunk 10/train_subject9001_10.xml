	<TEXT> Same with my mom. Also anything on adult swim, I couldn't even watch futurama.  Now she lets my younger brothers watch family guy and all those shows. I think she just stopped giving a damn.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! And I plan on it haha. There is most definitely a time and a place for that type of thing,and plus there are some things that are best saved for when you're of age.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup. That crowd was insane. I actually crowdsurfed to get out, I was getting way too hot and lightheaded in there and there was no chance of walking out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, my bad. That wasn't a very accurate comparison.I was just trying to think of concert related risks, I didn't realize the implication there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see how being aware of the risks of something mean you're asking for them to happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please tell me where I said crowd surfing meant getting groped and undressed. I stated that that was a RISK of crowdsurfing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, because that isn't what I basically just said. I said that every girl who crowdsurfs knows that there is a risk of that happening. If you go skydiving knowing there is a chance your parachute may fail are you basically asking to die?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you guys should remember I was being carried through the crowd up by a sea of pumped up drunk people at a Slipknot concert. Every girl who crowdsurfs knows there is a chance of getting groped, that risk comes with the experience. Not to mention the bikini string could have very well been pulled accidentally. My perspective on this was a fun, memorable concert experience that left me with a better understanding of myself. 

**edit: my mosh pit comparison implied the opposite of my point, I'm sorry. I do not think that you are asking to get groped if you're a girl and you crowdsurf. ** </TEXT>
