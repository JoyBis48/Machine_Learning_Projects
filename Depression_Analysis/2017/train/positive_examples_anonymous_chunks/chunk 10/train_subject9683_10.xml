	<TEXT> If they're gonna do more Felicity-centric episodes, please leave romance out of it. Face her off against another hacker or explain who her dad is. Don't shove this Olicity bullshit down our throats. You've made so many improvements, Diggle gets a costume, Oliver is becoming the fun loving not-so-dark Green Arrow (to silence the Batman critics), we've got Speedy, and Star City. Please don't ruin all the endless possibilities with more Olicity, keep their romance on the down-low, make it subtle. Last season they were episodes where over 50% of it was Olicity romance and/or Felicity being emotional </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think just having a green hood, is considered honouring Yao Fei, to Oliver.

So i'd say it's all good. </TEXT>

I have hope for her, I just don't want Marc calling all the shots anymore, Olicity was overused and abused last season.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently still working on the first chapter, but I am posting it on fanfiction.net, which I think is the most populated fanfiction site, so it should get a lot of reviews and whatnot.

My mom wants to get me into a writers workshop or something, I'm not to thrilled about it because I have poor social skills but I think I might just do it because I've never really pursued anything I've loved to a full extent before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wendy Miracle is now the co-show runner, I think...

But she said she really wants to work on the strong female roles and Diggle. I think the show has always done well with Diggle but I have hope that we can see a Season 1/2-ish Felicity or an even better Felicity this season, and Laurel will finally be as badass as Sara.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wattpad, Fanfiction.net, or AO3? Which one should I post my fanfic on? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-11 00:45:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is not only a question for me, but if anyone has the same question, I think we should all help each other out with it.

andnbsp;

My fanfiction is about the tv series Arrow and The Flash (I guess Supergirl as well), where would be the best place to post this, I don't think Wattpad would be good because it's most popular fanfics are like One Direction stuff. I think you can keep updating your fanfic on FFnet and can release it in chapters. But I don't know if you can post pictures in your story like on AO3. I'm just really confused as to where to post it. I want to use AO3 but can I post my story chapter by chapter? and keep going back to edit it? Without it expiring? 

andnbsp;

I know my question was all over the place -.-" </TEXT>
