	<TEXT> I've been on Tri-Previfem for about 3 years now, and it was my understanding that it's supposed to stop ovulation. However, I still get all those ovulation symptoms: change in cervical fluid, change in cervical position and firmness, cramping on one side, etc. Just like I did before starting BC.

I haven't gotten pregnant so it must be working, but I really think I'm ovulating as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've had sexual problems in the past. I'm HL, she's LL. Before, we've had problems in having consistent, regular sex more than once every 2-3 weeks. Recently, we've made progress and had sex twice a week a few weeks ago. But that was several weeks ago.

I'm really LL, but me and my HL boyfriend are exactly the opposite. We have sex several times a week, and I agree to it just so I don't have to deal with him pestering me about it. Having sex for 1/2 hour (he lasts forever) is preferable to listening to him say, "Hey, touch my dick" for an hour. We've only gone a month without sex once, and that was after I had a painful medical procedure and was unable.

I also didn't dare try to put it off on his birthday. I just gave in without any resistance. He'd never hurt me, but his anger and the pestering would have been multiplied by 5, I'm sure. Easier to just give in.

It isn't him. He's good at sex. I'm just on anti-anxiety meds and would rather do math homework than have sex some days.

I don't really have any advice for you, I just noticed that my experience is quite different from most other peoples' on here. I give in while other women (and some men) just refuse to have the sex. </TEXT>

They didn't have kids so further generations could exist. They had kids because they needed extra hands on the farm, because there was no reliable birth control, because it was expected of them, and maybe even a few times because they wanted kids.

	<TEXT> Late term abortions are illegal in most states except for cases that endanger the woman's life, so it's time to let that go. The vast majority of abortions occur long before the fetus has any real nervous system to feel anything. Late term abortions are also expensive and hard on the woman's body, so women aren't getting them for fun.

the number of jews killed by hitler doesn't even approach this historically.

Because a forming fetus without a nervous system is the same as 6 million Jews. lol okay.

oh it's the shipping cost. ok then

Planned Parenthood has funding problems. They depend on private donations because many states have laws that tax dollars can't fund them.

If they were able to sell fetus organs, they wouldn't be in such dire financial need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to look at aborting fetuses as killing babies, that's your business, but PP isn't selling the organs. In the unedited video, the PP doctor says, “It has to do with space issues, are you sending someone there who is doing everything, or is their staff, what exactly are they going to do, is there shipping involved or are you coming to pick it up.”

She's likely outlining the costs for shipping and handling items marked as fragile. Not to mention the measures it takes to preserve the specimens and store them properly in transit. That takes money.

Of course, I know not all women have access to on request abortion in the USA, and that's an issue that needs a lot of work, but I've always felt privileged in this matter as the one with the uterus.  </TEXT>

We've all seen messages on Facebook that say, "Take all photos of your children down! Pedophiles are stealing them and using them to masturbate!"

That's a pretty absurd moral panic. For one, how would you know this? Two, pedophiles don't need photos of your kids. They can do a Google search for "children" and have all the pictures they need. Three, if you're that terrified that a pedo might jerk off to photos of your kid, why take your kid out in public at all? Pedos might snap a photo without you knowing! Better keep them inside! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, SRS, let's explain this to your slow asses once again.

We do not make laws based on what we find icky. We base laws on what hurts someone. Drawing pictures of sexy children isn't illegal because it isn't hurting anyone. It's icky, but isn't hurting anyone. Taking a photo of a child meant to be sexy is hurting someone, so that's illegal. See how it works?
