Don't get me wrong, I like my lovable 80s comic characters, but I feel like Pym would be able to be a more consistent parallel between what has happened in the original Marvel Universe (616) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Edit: according to several people, Pym will be appearing in the Ant Man movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I head into Meps this Wednesday and Thursday,  but I know I will be put on a DEP because of my braces, so the earliest I could go to basic would be late February - early March. My main questions are: 
What should I look for in my contract (loans being paid back, school being paid for, mos, rank, etc)?
How much of what my recruiters push is complete bullshit (they aren't focused on me getting an education, but rather they keep trying to push the possible high salary that can come with being a nuclear engineer?
And what would happen If I decided to not sign my contract after passing all my physical and mental requirements (I can pass tape and am likely to get a near perfect score on the ASVAB)? </TEXT>

That is the cry of Star Platinum trying as hard as he can to protect Jotaro from the swarm. I want to believe that with the power of precise movements and the urges of Stand master preservation,  Star Platinum would fend off all the bees, but I do not think he could move fast enough to protect Jotaro from a swarm of the bees stinging him. Maybe they could do the heart stop thing to prevent blood flow so the venom doesn't circulate while it gets separated from the blood cells and removed from the body,  but I doubt that would even work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally, the chapters that haze are becoming more and more of the minority amongst Greek Life as a whole. Honestly, there are other ways of building the bonds between members that will last a lifetime. Personally, spending time around all of my fellow brothers doing things like catching dinner or even hanging out playing Xbox (not stereotypical CoD or sports) makes me feel like we are all connected beyond our memberships in our respective chapters. 

I do not have any hazing experiences myself, as I'm not big on hazing people, and there wasn't really any type of initiation requirement or anything of that sort that could be considered hazing, within the wordings of both public perception and our National Fraternal Constitution.

	<TEXT> A little bit of a background about me: I'm 20 y/o, and can meet all the physical requirements asked of me for the branch I am looking at (Navy), I scored in the upper 90s on the ASVAB test, and I have 2 years of college under my belt, with about another 3 before I get my Bachelor's Degree. I plan on entering the engineering side of things, specifically, nuclear engineering. I plan on entering the military either way (with or without a degree) but I would like to hear thoughts from all sides on whether I should just finish out school before enlisting, or I should go in now? </TEXT>

Star Platinum can probably catch most bullets shot at him. He would probably go off into hiding or gamble since he would likely be very disinterested in the rest of the world, but he would do just fine.

Favorite character: Vegeta (DBZ)
Least favorite character: Ash's Pikachu (Pokemon)

This depends entirely on the amount of plot armor that is allowed. Yes, both of them have plot armor to a degree,  but I'm pretty sure that stupid Pikachu has ungodly amounts of plot armor. I hate that mouse for that, and the fact that my Pikachu doesn't have any durability compared to Ash's.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alucard (Hellsing) vs Wolverine (Marvel)

1. In character, both of them would likely fight, since Wolverine as a mutant would likely be someone Alucard would hunt. I feel like most rounds would be a contest of Alucard's souls vs Wolverine's healing factor. I would give the victory to Alucard's souls and vamperic powers. Alucard 6.5/10

2. Bloodlusted: if Wolverine can chop off Alucard's head and rip out his heart on a speedblitz, then Wolverine would win (odds are about 4/10, IMO) More than likely, Alucard would go level 0 and Wolverine's healing factor would not be able to keep up with the sheer amount of injuries he would suffer. Alucard 6/10.

3. Prep: Wolverine would know what to do to actually kill Alucard, and Alucard would know how to beat adamantium skeletons and healing factor, but I would give this to Wolverine 6/10, because I think prep helps Wolverine more than it would Alucard </TEXT>
