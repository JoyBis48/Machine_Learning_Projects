	<TEXT> I had a motorcycle accident when I was 19. I saw her crossing the traffic, I had the right of way, she just pulled in front of me. Nothing I could do. 

I lived in Florida at the time and the only thing that went through my head was "I hope she has insurance." I was wearing my helmet and it's a good thing I was because there's no graceful way to land when you flip head first over and 35 feet past a car. 

Broke my clavicle and needed surgery, its a good thing she had insurance otherwise I would have been fucked for years. FHP at the hospital told me I was lucky, most of the motorcycle accidents he saw were deaths or in so much pain they couldn't answer questions. 

Didn't do the life flashing or regrets, none of that. I like it better that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actively try to make myself downwind, around the corner, etc, but I cannot control the goddamn wind. Smoking is not the only thing that can kill you and statistically speaking, if you don't smoke or live with a smoker, then you have more important things to worry about. 

Like almost anything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Light could have been better. Damn time change put the sun too high in the morning and not far enough over in the afternoon. Between 1-2 it was crap. 

Plus we had to fight for good spots with the 100 other people chasing it. 

Waiting to see the how the video came out though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Example:

The bar I used to work at Served Evan Williams Green Label at $3.50 a drink. Retail A fifth is ~$10.00. IF you get 20 servings from a bottle, 3.50 x 20 = 70. That's a 700% markup. Until you factor in rent, electric, maintenance, labor (and this really depends on location) etc, that bottle is 2-3x as expensive. 

The markup for anything is a significant amount, if you don't include overhead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Accidental overdose maybe. Aderall, Ritalin, etc are considerably more safe than legal opioids or cocaine. 

Having used these types of drugs, you would have to experience considerable pain before you do major damage to yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had about half a fifth of whiskey and it made sense in the manner that you were saying that coke was responsible for many deaths. 

Though, going back, I understand you were saying that legal amphetamines were responsible for many deaths, and on that I would have to disagree wholesale. The numbers do not suggest that RX amphetamines are killing remarkably large numbers of people. </TEXT>

Pretty sure Google got started because someone had the powdery balls to sell it to a friend.

Edit: Alcohol kills a (metric) shitload of people every year. And yet adds a considerable amount to our economy. Regulated? ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY. Banned? I don't know. </TEXT>
