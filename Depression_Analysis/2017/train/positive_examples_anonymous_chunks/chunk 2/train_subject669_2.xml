	<TEXT> Depends on the outcome of their lie. If it's pre-donation and usage of the donation, they will be put on our permanent deferral registry and wouldn't be able to donate anywhere in the country. Huge red mark.

If they make it through donation, it's a different story. When I was going through my training I was told about a guy who ended up doing jail time for possibly contaminating the supply and fined several thousand dollars. Outcomes will vary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked as a phelbotemist at a blood center for awhile, basically every potential donor has a long questionnaire that includes questions about potential sexual lifestyle hazards. If you are a male, have you ever had sexual contact with another male? Medical supervisors review questionnaires and anyone deemed a risk is permanently banned from donating. It basically relies on honesty because I've seen people who are gay donate (I don't know if they're sexually active or virgins or what).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally see your point, I think the reason it's often called "feminism" is because while men do have some issues in our society, women have more "catching up" to do in terms of social equality. For example how women weren't always allowed to vote etc. 

It's often named in terms of the group that needs uplifting. Like how gay people are trying to get the same marriage and non-discrimination rights as straight people, so "gay rights".  </TEXT>
