	<TEXT> **"Platform" lyrics:**

**verse one**

Neon lights on the dust on the ground on the bus

Dirty roads makes that scarf wrap a must

Rolling by scrolling for the future on the app

Data mine my mind like a diamond in the ruff

**chorus**

Platforms here's a train of thought

Getting to the bright side of me is why I fought

I'm gonna say what else have I got

Maybe there's glory in all the things I'm not.

**verse two**

If oil is the god then the cranes all pray

The crude is so rude

It makes the people pay

On the side of the road men make money

A flower for a dollar man

He wants a family

If I rose to power

It'll be a bouquet

Emoji a smiley

And say I'm OK

The tech dudes are the only ones having a good day

And talking is cheap

Coz they make it easy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, please make a change in your diet.  Eat more unprocessed, actual foods... i.e. fresh fruits and vegetables.  I like to drink a strong roasted dandelion root tea to soften stools and to cleanse the liver.  Also you can try ginger to aid digestion; I do not, however, know of any laxative or stool-softening effects in ginger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> okay, fair point. my family maintains a small organic farm, and yes, we do use pesticides. but they are formulated to be safer than those normally used. 

so my wording was a bit off. teavana teas have been shown to contain dangerous levels of pesticides, and i have actually felt a nauseating, toxic sensation upon consuming some of their teas. now i find it practical and even necessary to be discerning, but i realize there are many people who have desirable experiences with tea regardless of the product’s ‘organic’ status. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> thoughts on organic tea? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> alright r/tea, question time.

what are your thoughts on organically-grown and processed teas? are they frivolous luxury, absolute necessity, or complete nonsense altogether?

personally, i tend to go for the organic stuff; this habit arose after having several not-so-pleasant experiences with (teavana) teas grown using pesticides.

sometimes, though, i feel as if i’m missing out on some great tea experiences because of strict standards and a reluctance to deviate from any product that lacks organic certification.

what are your thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> :) a few months back i purchased a pound of organic fukamushi from Den's Tea, and i tend to agree with this assessment. my only question is... how does the extra steaming affect the leaf's health benefits? obviously the leaf becomes more particulate with the fukamushi process, but does that indicate any damage to the leaf's nutritional integrity? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i personally prefer fukamushi for its grassy overtones and particular cloudiness. just curious what others prefer between these differently-steamed Japanese greens and why. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hello,
i am going to be posting a simple preference-based question every few days just to help myself and others flesh out a greater understanding of the subtle-*teas* inherent to the world and culture of *camellia sinensis*.

so, for round one, the questions arises from the japanese tea tradition.  do you personally prefer the delicate freshness of a traditionally-steamed sencha or the heavier, more robust cloudiness of a more thoroughly-steamed fukamushi-sencha?  why? </TEXT>
