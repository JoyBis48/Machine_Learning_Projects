My Alien Pet ::
Name :: Jerome (pronounced Jay-Roh-May)

My pet is the Realest nigga alive, and non-humans ain't even considered niggas, but that's what makes Jerome unique.
You see in 1993, Jerome landed on a planet called Kintekai, it was the land of Fried Chicken! Jerome lived there for 21 years. On November 4th 2014, Jerome appeared in my room, he was tall, muscular, looked like a human, and had real nigga traits, he had a high top fade, 8 pack natural abs, and he would sweat grape drink, not grape juice, grape drink. Anyways, Jerome didn't introduce himself to me like a normal alien (e.g. "I come in peace."), instead he(at least I'm assuming it a he, due to his name and appearance), introduced himself like this: "Yo Dawg, is you Timothy?" To which I responded..."Yes, but my parents are asleep please keep it down", he then proceeded to say: "Nah, nigga, don't worry b, only you can hear me, infact, you can respond to me, using your thots, I mean thoughts, I was sent from the planet Kintekai, to be your pet, but I don't play dat homo sh** mayne, no offensive to gays, but by pet, I don't mean no intimate stuff, iight my nigga?"...I said "lol...alright"(yes I actually said 'LOL') then we played some 2k, and then I checked reddit and saw this...so yeah. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember commented on a Lakers post about Julius Randle.
As a Pacers fan, I understand what it feels to have multiple players injured (george, west, hill, watson). 
But if you saw how Roy Hibbert played (22pts 8reb 7blk), i can guarantee you, someone will step up, whether it be Ibaka, or like you said Perry Jones, someone will. I'm sorry for your lost, and  I don't really understand how bad it might feel, playing in a strong West Conf.
But nevertheless, I wish you guys the best on your season. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a Pacers fan, and I understand how you guys feel **completely**
Just like how Paul George has MVP potential.
I believe Julius Randle has the potential to not only be a perennial all star, but the face of the Lakers franchise down the road.
Competitiveness aside, I wish you guys the best on your season. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i still say its worth it, im just pissed off with that fact that i cant use VC on MyCAREER cuz it doesnt connect to 2K Sports server, so idk if i can play crews or myplayer blacktop anymore.

it doesnt say i cant play it, it just says offline MyCAREER means using Skill points instead of VC..

i hope i can still play blacktop online or crews if i ever find people to make one </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (i own a ps3 copy of the game)

only graphic changes are Nick Young's hair, Anthony Davis and Jimmy Butler have mini afros, and Chandler Parsons looks real for once, they still haven't given Steve Nash the hair he's had for so long now, since he joined LA (2k13).

and the 2k sports servers are retarded.
every time it autosaves its supposedly "retrieving your files from the 2k Sports Server" for like 50 seconds

and when i create a MyCAREER, it says im unable to connect to the 2k Sports Server so i either play offline MyCAREER or get sent back to the main screen with KD on it. 

Then when i go to load the MyCAREER, instead of letting me go to edit my player/play game/look at my player, it sends me back to play the **Rookie Showcase**

When looking for a match online the game stays at 
**HEAD-TO-HEAD**
**Searching for matches...**
until you cancel it.

2K Heroes mode also doesnt work because...you cant match up with anyone to play online.

MyTEAM is undergoing maintenance.
Wait...hold on, im trying right now
it'll be a while since its **RETRIEVING DATA OF WHATEVER FOR 3 HOURS**

*takes chill pill*

alright, im making a team, since i cant make a MyCAREER....actually maybe i'll check out MyCAREER and see if it works, now that MyTEAM works.
i named myTEAM the Toronto Lynxes...cuz apparently the "Lynx" is native to toronto, or something like that.

My starting lineup is Canaan, Rivers, Joe Harris, Jeremy Evans, and Sims

OH look i can play someone .__.
so whats wrong wi- **HOLY SILVER PLAYERS**, Kevin Durant. omg, k well, im about to lose cya :D </TEXT>
