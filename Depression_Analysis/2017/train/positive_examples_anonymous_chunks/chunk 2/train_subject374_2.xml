	<TEXT> A rough looking homeless guy approached me at the bus stop in the city, I figured he would ask for spare change or a ciggie - he instead asks me "what's a lovely girl like you doing in a dump like this". Sweet man made my day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on a school camping trip and we had gone snorkeling one afternoon, our guide for the day can't have been more than 5 years older and was smoking hot. I wasn't a huge fan of breathing out of my snorkel so I was slightly panicking. When I saw from my underwater view that everyone was perched on a rock resting I was stoked. I was even more stoked to see that among all the perchers was the smoking hot guide in a wet suit that hugged all the right places. I "accidentally on purpose" grabbed his junk as he helped me climb up onto the rock. I was 12. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aye? Her automatic payment had already processed, she went ahead and made another payment through online banking because she didn't read her invoice that stated she didn't have to do anything further - we're happy to refund the second payment back but I don't see how that's our "system's fault" that she didn't read the information on her invoice. People have a responsibility as a consumer to read the information they are given for a product/service they subscribe to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's just one that bugged me, I didn't have time to add any of my other stories. There was a time someone wasn't happy with our policies (her bill was very much overdue) she was yelling and swearing for approximately 19 mins straight and after telling her my surname (she asked) she completely lost her shit...."what kind of surname is that?" blah blah blah and questioning whether I was "even a New Zealander" - that stung a little bit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A customer had accidentally paid her bill twice, she lets me know that she wasn't aware she had an automatic payment set up and stated that she was a busy teacher ("grappling with reports etc.") so she picked up the invoice and paid it without thinking. She suggested the "system" should be clearer to remind her about the automatic payment. The bill clearly states she has an automatic payment in place and that she does not need to worry about making a payment....no wonder she's grappling with those reports... </TEXT>
