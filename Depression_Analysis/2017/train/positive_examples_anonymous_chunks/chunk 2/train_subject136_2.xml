	<TEXT> I wish I had the answer.  It's sad.  The ironic thing is that there are more blacks in college than any other period in history yet there's probably more teenage pregnancies as well.  So we're doing better, but worse at the same time.

Oh yeah I used both *buscar* and *encontrar* in the passage above because I'm not sure which one I should've used.  

I also have a hard time finding subtitles for English movies dubbed in Spanish.  The ones I find are slightly off.  The actors are using a script so I'm sure the proper version exists somewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> did you give her a real chance? - no rebound, pity acceptance of relationship, sex only relationship, other. crap reasons to be with someone

It was a semi-rebound I guess. but I gave her a chance

were you attracted to her? physically, intelectually, emotionally

Of course.  

what are the best things about her?

She's independent, smart, attractive, genuinely fun to be with at times.

what are the worst things about her?

She is the total opposite of me and is HIGHLY emotional.  She can be rude and cut people off when talking.  Also in most cases she lacks the ability to look at herself from other's perspective.  and she can be a tad bit materialistic.

what's her favourite thing? something that always makes her smile

Makeup accessories, Hello Kitty, coffee, tea... I could go on and on.

what was the greatest thing you've ever done for her happyness alone?

I cant single out one thing by itself.  I spoiled her at Christmas though.

have you thought about her while out with friends/work wtv?

Sure.

have you always been there for her when she was sad? have you done stuff to make her happy after?

Usually.  The only problem is since she's so emotional, she gets sad and mad a lot.  This is admittedly my weak spot because I never know what to do in these situations so I just listen and try to be empathetic.  Best thing I can do is take her mind off of it.

ever thought about marrying her? giving her babies?

Not until right before the end.  I would have kids with her.  She only wants one but I think that she was open to changing that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's not saying it because he doesn't love you.  He might care about you A LOT, but saying it is a probably a pretty big deal to him.  He would probably feel all sorts of anxiety and pressure once he says it.

I put my last girlfriend through something similar before I cut it off since I wasn't in love as much as she was.  No one should ever have to be in a lopsided relationship.

Keep in mind my actions all pointed to me loving her.  I did everything you could ask a bf to do, but my heart wasn't all the way in it.  

If it's an issue to you it's probably worth bringing it up with him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She was in love and I wasn't ready for all that.  We were together 7 months.  I feel like I did her a favor by not wasting her time any more.  But now I feel lonely and sad.  

I'd reach out to her but I feel it's a selfish move if I'm not ready to give it my all.  I really wish we could be friends and I hope she's around when I get it all together but she has a strict "no contact" policy with exes.

Any advice?  



**TL;DR.**  Dumped gf, right decision, help me feel better about it. 

**EDIT:  I think I may actually love her.  But I'm not sure.  How can you be sure?  I feel like the fact that I'm not sure means I should leave it alone.** </TEXT>

It's just a start.  I got bored one day at work and ran with it.  I'm sure someone else could do a MUCH better job.

My logic was to create a basic avatar comprised of cells that I could fill in with the colors of clothes I actually own.  This allows me to get an idea how colors work together when layering.

The downside is that its very hard to get patterns (plaid, etc.) in Excel.  Also, I had to make my best guess as to find the closest color to khaki and the jeans I own. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> No offense to the non-black guys.  It's just that ***I've heard it all before.***

I currently use a pair of Andis T-Outliners to cut my facial hair.  I still get razor bumps but its kept to a minimum.

Every now and then I get the urge to shave with a razor and it **always ends up badly**.  I even splurged on an Art of Shaving kit one time using the brush with the lather and oil before shaving, etc.  I followed the instructions on the dvd and  STILL got crazy razor bumps.

My facial hair is very coarse, thick, and curly.  Even more so than the typical African American's.  To put it in perspective **I can use a depilatory like extra strength Magic Shave, leave it on my face for 30 minutes (double the time listed on the container), and it will still leave a good 30% of my hairs on my face.**  My facial hairs are some tough sons of bitches.

So any input is welcome.  I'd grow out my beard if it didn't look so sparse and patchy.  Also, my beard grain goes in all types of directions so shaving with cream and not being able to see the hair is a risk I'm concerned about.

A search brought me here and I'm really hoping this can solve one of my major dilemmas in life. </TEXT>
