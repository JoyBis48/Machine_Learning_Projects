	<TEXT> For New 52 I like the Batman Eternal weekly. The story is great and I cant wait to see how the Commissioner comes out of this. 

I've been pulling most of The Dark comics ( Justice League Dark, Phantom Stranger, Pandora) but havent quite read them yet since I am missing a couple issues here and there. The trades for them all are great. For Swamp Thing and Animal Man I just wait for their trades and have yet to be disappointed. 

Justice League United seemed to start out strong so I'll keep checking it out.
I do recommend Sword of Sorcery: Ameythst trade if you can find it. Since it was a short run it is all collected together.

Secret Origins is a nice take on the origins on well known heroes. 

Not exactly New 52, but still Vertigo, I do enjoy Sandman: Overture. However it is only two issues in and it is months in-between releases. </TEXT>
