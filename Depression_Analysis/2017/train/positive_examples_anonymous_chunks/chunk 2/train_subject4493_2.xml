	<TEXT> There is a communication breakdown here. She clearly does not want you running with this girl. Has she explained that to you? What she's doing is punishing you for running with this girl in an effort to get you to stop, when she should just explain how it makes her feel.

If she did something similar with a guy, how would you feel? If she point blank asked you to stop running with the girl, would you?

A lot of people in the thread are calling her a bitch and a jealous cunt and I really feel like it's unfair. Every relationship has to deal with jealousy to some extent. You need to talk to her about this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like your quote, "There is strength in solitude." Lately I have been focusing on being okay with myself and learning how to deal with my emotional issues on my own. When I tried to open up to others, I never felt like it did anything and I ended up just regretting opening up. I kind of had the epiphany that in the end we are alone, but that I was okay with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, so I think there's three options here.

1.) She doesn't realize feminist is not the same as feminine.

2.) She believes feminism's goal is to feminize men or make them more like women.

3.) She actually understands feminism but doesn't agree with it, and believes it makes men less masculine.

I just kind of stared into space for a bit and then went back to work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My ex was horrible about understanding my anxiety. We would be in public and I would start getting extremely anxious, so I would say I think I need to leave. He would be confused, say that I didn't look anxious, and proceed to continue doing whatever we were doing in public (shopping or whatever). Then I would say, I need to leave, I'm leaving, and he would get all butthurt and claim I used my anxiety as an excuse to not spend time with him. Sigh. Hence the ex part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aww. My mom says the same thing to me. I got divorced recently and she tells me all the time how happy I am and how the "old me" is back. Pff. I'm still lonely as hell and just cause I got divorced doesn't mean my depression just disappeared. 

My advice is to throw yourself into something to keep your mind off of things. I bought a bunch of video games because when I was married I never, ever spent any money on myself, and at night if I was feeling alone I'd throw myself into a game. Also I drank a lot of rum. Things will get better :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does feel like people who are overweight get this bad rap of being a grumpy person. Or, if an overweight person happens to be grumpy that day it's all of a sudden, well, she's grumpy cause she's fat. It's kind of bullshit. 

It just makes no sense the amount of hatred people can spew over someone's freakin' weight. Like I went on /r/fatpeoplehate and was just floored. People waste time over this? 

Not to even mention the double standard of fat dudes vs. fat chicks. Like one of the friends I was hanging out with was an overweight dude, and even he was getting in on it. No one gives a shit if a guy is overweight, and if the overweight dude can't get chicks, it's because girls are shallow, but if an overweight girl can't get dudes it's her fault because she's fat. UGH!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the advice. My divorce pushed me in a lot of ways to put myself out there and socialize more. I had so much anxiety initially, especially when going on dates, but now I'm noticing that's subsiding which is a huge relief. I'd like to get back to the point where I only had situational anxiety. 

I think you're right about finding a guy who isn't depressed. My ex fed off of my moods and would be down when I was down, and it wasn't helpful. 

I find that when I get depressed, my body and brain tell me to lay in bed to make it feel better. My strategy now is to get out and do things, to fake it, like you said. This has helped me a lot. It's hard to fight against that feeling though. A mantra for me had basically become "I can't" so I think in many ways my fight now is to just convince myself that I can.  </TEXT>

It makes it hard to date because honestly I don't even know who I am without my depression. I get down on myself thinking no one wants to be with a girl who has depression. And even if I meet a great guy I think eventually he won't like me because of my issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! I'm looking for new friends to hang out with. I recently got divorced and realized how little friends I have. I'd love to hang out with other women who are redditors and have similar interests. 

I don't mind if you're attached, but I'm single so I would love to go out with someone to meet guys! I'm looking to just have fun at this point in my life. 

I want to get outside more and do active things but I don't know a lot of people. I like hiking, exploring, geocaching, etc. I love beer and trying new kinds, exploring different bars and restaurants. 

Hope to hear from you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None of this sounds normal honestly, or healthy. He sounds like he is insecure and wants to control your life by being emotionally manipulative. 

It might be mild now, but what happens if in the future he asks you to stop hanging out with your guy friend altogether? He doesn't sound like he has YOUR interests in mind at all. 

Personally, having had experience with this type of guy, I would get out of that relationship. In my experience these guys only get worse over time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, he admitted to the affair, but covered up a lot of details about it. It took me a few months of sleuthing, talking to the woman who he cheated with, talking to her husband, to really get a picture of what really happened. And I'll never know for sure. It's a messy business. 

The other big factor for me was that they didn't use a condom. So they risked pregnancy and stds. They risked my health. All to have an affair. It's just gross.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see what I did as punishment at all. I just don't want to be with a person who has an affair. For a lot of reasons. But my decision was about me and how I could be happy. Not about punishing him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a period of about a week after finding out about it that I was still weighing my options. I asked him some details about the affair (instead of coming clean he lied about a lot of the details and hid the fact that it happened multiple times rather than once), he looked at me, disgusted, and said, "When are you going to get over this?" 

I realized then that he did not realize how much he had hurt me, and he never would. He would never be the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I made my decision and I'm happy about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly it's quite complicated. There are a lot of details about the cheating that I won't go into online. But it was a combination of factors that led me to my decision. Why he cheated, who he cheated with, where he cheated, how many times it happened, what he thought while he was cheating, did he have remorse or guilt after before I knew about it. 

Then there is family and how they responded. My mom, who I'm close to, was livid. She said I could never bring him to her house ever again. Word spread throughout the family and everyone despised him. I would never be able to bring him to Christmas without it being a huge awkward moment for all of us. I regret telling my mother now, but maybe it was for the best. It is important to me that my family love and respect the man I am with, and that wasn't true anymore. 

In addition to that, it was how I was feeling in the marriage prior to the cheating. I was massively depressed and never felt like I could rely on him for anything. We were both starting to realize how little we had in common. We went to therapy, and realized how terrible we were at communicating with each other. Honestly it was a mess before the cheating. 

Despite any of that, for whatever reason, finding out he cheated was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. And I'm thankful my life is good enough that getting cheated on (so far) is the worst thing to happen to me. But it's hard to explain why it hurts so much. I don't think I really have an answer for you. 

Some nights I feel lucky I was cheated on because it gave me the courage to leave a marriage I wasn't happy in. So I don't know. We were both unhappy. But it's hard to really be honest with yourselves in a marriage when things aren't working.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah! I'm sure he thinks the same of me lol. But every day it gets easier and I think I'm at the point where I don't regret being married, it was an experience that taught me a lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hm, I'm not sure if I believe that, but I don't believe my relationship was healthy at all. I think we were both just young and resentful of each other for tying each other down too soon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good on you. Single life is not that bad. I love how much freedom I have now. It is a tough road so I hope you have friends and family to be there for you. But it's not as bad as staying in a relationship with someone who cheated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was a lot of reasons, I could write a book about it honestly. Let me just say this, I am divorced now and my sex drive has returned. 

I think it was mainly one, I was severely depressed, for whatever reason. I would literally not self lubricate and so sex was painful. Two, I just wasn't attracted to him anymore. He was really emotionally manipulative, incredibly jealous and would get upset if I went anywhere without him. Three, we were never really sexually compatible to begin with. I love dominant guys, he loved dominant girls. See the problem? 

Lots of reasons. Mainly issues of compatibility. If I could go back I would never have gotten married. I was young and dumb and believed in true love and soul mates.  </TEXT>
