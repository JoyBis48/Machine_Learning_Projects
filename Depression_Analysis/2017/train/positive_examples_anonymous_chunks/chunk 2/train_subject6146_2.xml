	<TEXT> How many girls' bedrooms do you see vs guys? Because thinking about it right now, there's a pretty even number of male vs female people in my life who live in extremely messy environments, and same for people being cleaner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, this is not the first time in my life that I have cleaned my entirely too messy room to this point only to let it get out of control again, but I don't have an income. $10 a month is too much, let alone $100 or even an apartment of my own. I hope that I can keep it clean this time. I know it's early to assume that this is how things are going to be, but just getting my room this clean is a huge success. It'll be an even bigger one if it still looks like this in a month. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been diagnosed to hell and back with a hundred different things. Only recently have I found a diagnosis and treatment that is actually helping. Depression has been a major one for a long time, but briefly my doctor thought maybe I was bipolar. Last year, I was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder and have been getting treatment for that, and there's such a difference. I've found meds that work, and therapy that works, and I hope this is the start of the rest of my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get it. I lived in that mess for two or more years. I was too embarrassed to have people in my room, let alone ask them to help me clean it. I just couldn't take it anymore.

If it's too much to ask for help, at least at the point it's at right now, try and clean some of it on your own. Maybe not all in one day, or even two. Just clean one small area and keep that neat, then move on to the next. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could not have done it without the help of my friend. Every time I tried on my own, I would just stare at the mess and get so overwhelmed. I didn't know where to start.

The best advice I can give is to start where you are going to be the most often. I started with my desk, then my bed, and then I just worked my way around my room until finally it was all done. Also, do it in short bursts instead of all at once. We started by doing 20 minutes of cleaning, 10 minutes of break, and by the end, I was able to work for longer and longer. Adjust the amount of time to something you're comfortable with (as long as it's not 5 minutes of cleaning, then break forever) and just remember that having a clean space will make you feel better and is something you can control in your life! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. And believe me, there have been pizza boxes and all kinds of gross food things in here. I hope you can find the motivation to clean, too. It helps a lot, having a clean space, even if it's just a clean space to mope in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It took a lot of effort and honestly, a few times, I just wanted to sit down and quit. I was just so tired of living like that, it sucks. I've lived in that mess for far, far too long. I just had to remember how much better I'd feel when it was finally clean, and how much easier it is to upkeep a clean room than it is to clean a room that is this disastrous. It didn't hurt that I had a friend urging me along to keep going and helping me out.

If I can do it, I bet you can do it too!! Just take it one corner at a time! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, I moved out of an apartment back home and somewhere along the way, my favorite set of dice got lost.

Recently though, my car was broken into... I was really upset, they actually stole a pewter DD figurine that I was going to paint and a pair of sunglasses (that was it though... so weird), but when I was going through the car cleaning out the broken glass, I found my old dice and I was so excited I started taking pictures.

So something good came out of something bad :) </TEXT>
