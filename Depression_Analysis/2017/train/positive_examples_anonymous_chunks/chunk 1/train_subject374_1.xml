	<TEXT> 8 years ago I applied for a retail job selling handbags, the store manager told me that there was a promising second in charge role opening in the next few months and because of my experience he had worked hard to negotiate with HR so that I could be paid an additional 10 cents per hour...the pay would have come to $10.20 per hour. I appreciate his efforts but it made the company sound a bit too thrifty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Up until the beginning of this year I had been friends with this person for 11 years since our uni days. In hindsight, it was a toxic friendship - I had to constantly walk on eggshells for fear of pissing him off, he constantly had tantrums, was very calculative and he only helped others if it benefited him. Everyone was scared to stand up to him because we didn't want to rock the boat. 

After coming home from a road trip with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday I spoke to a mutual friend about how hurt I was that this friend constantly sulked, got angry and even gave me the silent treatment for a couple of hours. This "friend" had told me on my birthday that when friends piss him off, he likes to make them feel like shit. That was the last straw for me, that's not what friendship is about. 
This mutual friend told this guy what I had said and obviously this "friend" of mine was royally pissed and started ignoring me while trying to gather a merry band of idiots to turn against me as well. He managed to turn another friend I had known for 11 years against me but was unsuccessful with the others. (We're all in our late to early 30s)

We never patched things up, I was very upset about it all for months but then I started realising that I was finally free of this toxic influence in my life and I could now enjoy the friendships I choose to nurture. It's not about how long you've known the person, it's about the kind of influence they have that matters for example, whether they're positive and supportive people. It's still very awkward when our original group gets together but it's OK, I'm spending most of my time now with wonderful amazing friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the simple things in life for me, I'm trying to appreciate what I have and concentrate my energy on the things I enjoy the most in order to find my own inner happiness and contentment. My biggest problem I'm trying to work on is to continue to work towards issues within my circle of influence rather than factors that I have no control over (circle of concern). </TEXT>
