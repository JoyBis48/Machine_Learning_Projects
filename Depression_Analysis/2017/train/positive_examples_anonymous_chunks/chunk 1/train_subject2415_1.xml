	<TEXT> I'm sorry I didn't really make that clear. We basically never bring up religion with her. We pray before meals, but that's all.  We don't regularly go to mass, but she wouldn't have to go if she chose not to. We may mention that we feel blessed because something happened, but we wouldn't get into a deep discussion about how God granted us life and it's good, etc. etc.

When she brings it up, she goes into lengthy discussions of "with logic, the Christian God is easily disproven" or something along those lines. I have never said to her face that "God is an obvious fact of life" because no one really knows. Yet she has to shove down our throats that she doesn't believe in God, when we honestly are fine with that.

If we were making her uncomfortable and she spoke her mind, I would understand. But it's more like there is a break in the conversation and she'll say "so I saw this article" and go into a religious rant. I would never do that for her sake, yet she doesn't have the same courtesy for me.

I have friends who are atheist, and we get along fine. We either don't bring up religion, or when we do, we agree to disagree. Just conversation, not debate. My sister just thinks (and she's made this clear, I'm not just saying this) that as an ateist, she is discriminated against, which she most definitely is not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My sister is an atheist and I am Christian. Being Christian, I know that I can't make a real point to my religion because it doesn't make sense; that's why it's called faith. I have no problem with my sister being atheist and think she can believe whatever she wants, yet she regularly brings up the beliefs of Catholics and why she is not one.  She not only does this around me, but around our Catholic family. Then we all get very uncomfortable because there is no way for us to back our beliefs because they are spiritual, not logical. I think she constantly brings it up because she is worried that people won't understand or are displeased with her for being atheist, yet we don't really have any opinion of it, we just don't want to have to explain to her why we believe what we believe because, well, we can't.

**TL;DR** People can believe whatever they like, just don't try to reason your beliefs because you'll just get in a heated discussion that makes everyone uncomfortable and angry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you definitely only want to give them one head shot. They're going to see a lot of people, they want as little from everyone as possible. Even if you will be wearing your glasses most of the time, auditioners want to see what you look like without them. It's just easier for them to know who and what they will be dealing with if you are hired. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like it! The clothes and scenery are definitely great. I would definitely suggest taking off the glasses in the future. When you're in an audition, your auditioners want to see your face and your entire face. Also, I might try having the camera from a higher angle than you face. It makes the picture seem lighter and happier, but that's just a preference of mine. Nothing to look deep into.

You look great! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my God, you're right!! I just remembered something!!

My junior high had a little radio station (online, noone listened to it) and they wanted to interview me (because i'm just that awesome, haha). I sang two songs, both of which were very sad. Afterword, I had a friend tell me that someone thought I was actually crying, but my friend said it like it was an insult. Like, why would I be crying? It's just a song about growing up without a father and all the regrets you have... nbd. I was totally embarrassed.

Anyway, thank you so much for that!! This just made this all so clear to me. Thank you, thank you, a million times, thank you!! I'd give you gold if I had money, sorry that I don't): </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a high school student and a musical theatre actress hopeful. Being that I'm going into theatre, my voice teacher doesn't just have me sing songs, but act them as well (as all singers should). If I am singing a very emotional song, I find myself afraid to really get into character. I don't know why, but I can't just... get to where I should be. I hold myself back.

Does anyone have any tips on what I can do to fearlessly get into character, no matter how... extreme the emotion? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may work for some people, but then eventually the reasons you reward yourself become smaller and smaller. Maybe at first, you smoke after cleaning the garage. Then it becomes after you did the dishes that were piling up. Then it's for making your bed in the morning.

Being an addict (not of smoking), I believe once you have an addiction, it never leaves you. You can tame it, but you can't get rid of it. Of course, each person is different, but I don't think it's worth risking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure a lot of people here will think this is a very minor problem, but to me right now it's huge. Right now, I'm on my school's drill (dance) team, and it's every single day, so it's basically my life for the next four years. I plan on going into musical theatre, so I enjoy being involved in my school's show choir as well. The problem is that since my drill team takes up such a huge part of my life, by next year I'll have to chose between drill and choir. If I quit drill, then I can join more of the after school choirs [women's, jazz (which is basically more advanced), etc.] and open my schedule to more rest, homework time, and other activities that I wouldn't have even been able to consider before. But if I give up on drill team, I would also be giving up a huge part of my life: performing at football games, not being with my team which is like a family, competitions, an everyday activity, a great exercise, and a huge label (that I really like). One of my biggest issues is that I enjoy being a leader, and not just a member, so I couldn't be a leader of either if I'm in both, because, sadly, conflicts will force me to choose. (I'll be able to stay in choir no matter what, but a much lesser portion that I would prefer.) Also, just to note, I am a very skilled singer (as I've been told by professionals, I'm not just conceited) and not the greatest dancer, but I'm pretty good and much better than someone without any experience. Note, if I gave up drill, I could also start dance lessons. It amy seem small to a lot of you, but it's a huge part of my life right now and could determine how the rest of my life pans out. Of course this is a very personal decision, but does anyone have any opinions or points that may help me sway one way or the other? Thank you!

	<TEXT> Hi.  I'm a fourteen-year-old girl who just started high school and is pursuing a career in musical theatre.  I'm just going to say this right now, I'm not some sort of Rachel Barry (Berry?) wanna-be or some sort of YouTube singer that has no talent or real aspiration, just looking for fame and money, no.  I've been aspiring toward the theatres of Broadway since I can remember and I don't want any sort of fame or money. I just want to sing and be heard. And yes, I liked it before it was cool, and I'm fully aware that makes me sound like a hipster.

Anyway, like I said, I just started high school, but I have all the expectation piled on me. Honestly and truthfully, I'm good. Some might say great or amazing, but I'm not trying to brag, I'm just letting you know.  Because of this, I'm expected to be amazing and inspirational and all that, but I'm not. My mother expects me to get perfect grades, my sister expects me to get the lead in the musical as a freshman, my entire choir expects me to be perfect and on top of my game every day and never make a mistake and they think it's okay to put all the attention on me sometimes when it makes me uncomfortable (because come one, it's a choir), and it goes on and on and on.

I can't handle it.

I know my limits and my abilities, but noone else does. I'm supposed to be perfect. When I make an achievement, noone cares because it's expected. When I break down, it's just not okay, I'm supposed to handle all of this. When I make a bad grade, my mother tells me that I won't get into college. When I make a good one, it doesn't affect her. I, honest to God, got a 101% in French (granted, it's only the first half of the first quarter), but she was unimpressed because the rest of my grades weren't quite there.  They're all B's and A's, and again: I. Just. Started. High. School.

I'm breaking down.

When I was twelve, I was diagnosed with clinical depression. All of my friends had abandoned me for a dumb reason I'm not willing to get into and my parents thought I didn't need help. Every time I reached out to someone for help, they thought I was lying, or be overly-dramatic. I had three failed suicide attempts. (Note: I AM NOT CURRENTLY SUICIDAL. THIS WAS A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.) Finally, my principal caught wind of my situation somehow and decided to suspend me until I got medical help. (Just saying, she's a bitch. Never, ever force anyone with a mental problem to get help against their will.) I went to a therapist, I went to the hospital. My parents were in shock. They thought I could handle my own problems. They didn't realize my mom not being there and my dad's abusive, alcoholic, depressive behavior had rubbed off on me. They still don't. They blame everything all on my own inability to take care of myself. I got out three days before my thirteenth birthday.

Now here I am, going down a scary path again. The only friends I can get right now and mean to me, selfish, and expect me to be perfect, my parents are ignoring me, and I have all these.... expectations.

I'm not okay.

I want to self injure again, I'm inclined to take pain killers (I'm not doing these things, nor do I plan to. Just inclined. I have self-control.), I'm lonely, I'm sad...

I'm not perfect.


Well, I guess that's all I really have to say. Thanks for listening to me ramble about myself. I really appreciate it. </TEXT>
