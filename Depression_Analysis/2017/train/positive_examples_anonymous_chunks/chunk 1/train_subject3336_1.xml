	<TEXT> Ambiguous header but true. I've survived suicide attempts (both my own and that of family members), self-harm, domestic abuse of a parent, depression, anxiety, bulimia and more.

I remember feeling so alone and like a freak for being different to everybody else. I founded The Unmarked Road to share my story, in hope it gives comfort to those going through hard times and struggling with their thoughts and emotions.

**Your past does not have to define your future.**

No matter how dark things appear, there is always a light. I know this because I have come out the other side of some of the deepest depth of despair imaginable. 

Through sharing our experiences, we can end the stigma of mental health together. I welcome all of you to share your stories with me.
