	<TEXT> Hey folks!

I have been doing online pokemon-battles since generation 3, but I stopped when I had a lot of work to do with my a-levels. Now that I finished them, I would like to start playing again, but in the meantime, X/Y did come out. I have not been able to play this generation myself so far, since I dont own a 3ds, so I have some problems getting into the new stuff.

So - are there any lists etc. about changes that came in X/Y, or an overview about the new Pokemon and their possibilities? That would really help me.

Thanks a lot!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grave of the fireflies all the way. When watching it, I was like "my god i cant even."

Personally, I also want to mention "the voices of a distant star". its only a little movie, and surely some people will find it nothing but boring, but for me, being in a long-distance relationship myself...well, I guess you see.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Coming from LoL, I have some questions about this game. Wanna help me? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey guys.
As title states, I am a player of League (not high elo or somthing, just playing for a while) and frustrated from some things at that game I decided to try something new and ended up with Smite. So far, I really like this game, especially the mythological stuff is something I really like better than made-up characters. But there are some points that are still confusing me a lot, so help a newbie? :)

1. There are not a lot of guides for Gods in the Internet, and most of them are poorly rated. So, how exactly do I know how to build my god? Do I just stick with the recommended items, or are those not reliable? 

2. Is there a "meta" in this game and if yes, how does it look? I already noticed that there is a jungler, too, so maybe it is the same as in LoL? if yes, who are support gods? they are all tagged as mages or tanks, are they still used as support or does this work different?

3. are the side lanes called "left / right" or "top /bot" ? seen both so far. 

4. Do you have any recommodation what god to buy first as a newbie? which ones are easy to handle for beginners? the role is not that relevant, I do not particularily like tanks tho.

5. Last point: Are there gods that are currently considered over-/underpowered. I tried Thanatos in the practice mode, and from my point of view, his ultimate is ridiculously op, is that right? what makes it balanced, if not? I mean, AoE execution (and 40% health is not THAT low) and a stun? thats hard i think.

I guess thats all for now. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I have OCD and can't have fun in this game unless I build every possible building in a city. Is there any hope for me to play a game above chieftain? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Title. Suffering from OCD (yes, I know that a lot of people these days claim to have it, but unfortunately I actually do), I feel uncomfortable as long as there are buildings left in a city. Usually I play on chieftain or even settler and build a huge economy to spend all my money on buildings in new cities.
Anyway, I would guess that this isn't a proper strategy to win on higher levels.

My question is: Do you have any idea, if there is a possibility to keep my habit when playing higher? Maybe a civ or a strategy which does not require to expand to heavily, or makes it possible to have high production with fairly low science ? Or any mods that might help?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The password recovery does not work. What can I do to get my account back? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey guys.
I haven't played Audiosurf for a long time, and when I now logged in, I remembered why. I don't know the password of my account anymore. Or, I should rather say, accounts, because whenever I faced this problem before, I created a new account (I don't know why I always forget these passwords. I have the feeling that they are correct but there's some kind of error). 

I tried to use the password recovery here: http://www.audio-surf.com/resetPassword.php, but I never receive an E-Mail altough I'm absolutely sure the data is correct. I've run out of E-Mail-adresses, so I can't just make a new acc like before, so i would appreciate any help to get my acc back. </TEXT>
