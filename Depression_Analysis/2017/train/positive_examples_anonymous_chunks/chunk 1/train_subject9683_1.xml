	<TEXT> Unfortunately, The Knicks and Kings have a much better chance of getting Rondo, if we trade anyone, we're done. Let's see how Hibbert and West lead the team this year. Maybe Stuckey can put up big numbers, his stats when he got starter minutes were just slightly worse than D-Wade this season. Let's hope Solomon Hill is a decent player. Lastly, let's hope Solomon Hill doesn't become the most improved player and Larry Bird does something stupid like trade PG, like they did with Granger, and let's hope they don't trade Hibbert for Monroe, cuz Monroe is only gonna demand a huge contract or leave in free agency. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I don't know if people are still looking at this. But....without further ado..

My name is Tim, I posted gaming videos, sometimes Chatroulette trolling, and occasionally a tutorial. 

I do have a capture card for PS3 gaming, but I need to buy HDMI Cables and PS3 HD/AV Component cables

I'm only 15, and I've had a YouTube account since I was 9 lol, but this channel isn't the one from 2007, I made this to start a new chapter in life.

I struggle with depression and anxiety like many teens but I'm also very socially awkward so YouTube is my way to escape from reality, somewhat.

I don't really like posting just gameplay, I like to discuss thing, I'm just not a vLog person so, I commentate over gameplay.

I hope you enjoy my content and subscribe.

	<TEXT> Have you ever thought of embracing the fact that you made a mistake. For instance, I once did something on instagram that made me look gay in front of most of my friends, but I eventually embraced it, if I accidentally did something "homo" I'd just say "oh well I guess I'm gay" and people would laugh. Soon everyone forgot.  </TEXT>
