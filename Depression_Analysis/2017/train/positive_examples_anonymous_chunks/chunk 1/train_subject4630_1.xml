the only thing that's changed is the qualifications of what is a "good grade." straight A's will always get you into college, even if it's not MIT. </TEXT>

They need to patch it and stop doing this, like the prestige tokens. Why should people get banned? They didn't mess up or change the code or do ANYTHING that they were told they weren't allowed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How did you first get involved with clans in general?
I googled CoD clans, picked one that sounded interesting to me
How did you get into the current clan you participate in?
Last one broke up, I migrated with some members
What are the benefits of being involved with your clan?
Mw3 is terrible to play by yourself, we're a strictly "for fun" clan so it lets you play with people you know.
Has it created a community/friendships for you?
Yeah, definitely. We communicate and help each other out, joke around, and practically spend every night shouting at each other (In a good way. ish, lol)
Do you know anyone from the clan outside of xbox live?
no
If so, how?
nope
What is the goal of playing with a clan?
fun and playing with people you know
 . What methods do you use to set up matches?
Just whoevers online joins a lobby/party
Do you see a competitive future for your group?
Not at all
How do you stay in touch with fellow clan members?
Just whoevers online, party chat.

Clan name's Rise Against Gaming, changed from Soldiers of Desolation (SoD). Good luck with your project </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help with awkward situation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-03-14 00:06:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>    So there's this girl I talk to once in a while, same friend group as me. However, according to some of her friends, and her obvious actions, she has a crush on me (Yay not foreveralone!) I'm not opposed to anything possibly happening between us, however, every time we have a conversation, she makes it super duper awkward. Like, if I say I like something, she'll make a big deal about liking it too... and then it dissipates into silence. Any advice on making the situation more comfortable?

P.S. if any of you spell awkward wrong, I will cry. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the past several years, I've been a straight A student. I went to high school three years early by moving to a city that had a program that allowed me to do that. I've always had a pretty good work ethic. For the past couple months, though, I've been having difficulty maintaing my school work. I've done literally no work outside of class. I scrape by by making up lies and turing stuff in late. Is there any way to get back into a system where I can get motivated? It's gotten so bad I spent more time on reddit writting this post then I did on my eight page history paper due... 1st block tomorrow. Any help would be great.

EDIT: I was diagnosed with depression a year ago, and it's been downhill ever since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've shouted that exact same phrase at my friends, lol "This is game frustration, chill out" if they get mad in real life. I think it's a sign that you're getting into the game. Of course, it can evolve into real life frustration, but I think a healthy array of emotions is good for gaming. Getting "game frustrated" relieves anger in real life for me, and makes the game that much more captivating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What works for me whenever this happens is to sleep. And a fair amount of tears :/ Anger is what makes it go away for me. Probably really weird. But getting mad at the sadness. Determination to make it go away. Pissed off at what it's doing to you, me, everyone. For some reason whenever I feel utterly terrible I drive really fast and tell the sadness to F off, I'm going faster then it can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Skyrim: Awesome. Waaaay to many bugs and glitches, but it's the best work of art I've ever seen. if you need proof of this, just look at the sky for ten seconds in the game. 

Worst...: This pains me to say, because mw3 is my favorite game (sue me) but it really is junk artistically. Same format for everything, copy of mw2 virtually, simple menu and texture packs. Done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My type of game is cod :( I know, hate on me but it's what I enjoy. However, if I bought the game because I enjoyed the story, I would be incredibly stupid. I might play the first mission. But probably not. So far on mw3, I've got 20 minutes on the campaign, and 8 days on the multiplayer. Campaigns are just gone from those games, but I'm not really into single player so I'm okay with that. </TEXT>
