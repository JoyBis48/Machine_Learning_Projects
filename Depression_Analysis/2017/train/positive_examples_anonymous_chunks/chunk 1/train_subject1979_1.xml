	<TEXT> Exactly. If you've set a boundary verbally multiple times, and this isn't something that she's willing to respect, it's probably going to be a more serious conversation. My boyfriend gets these spots, and I ask if I can get them, when he says no, he's made it clear it's NO.
He usually doesn't mind, but sometimes he's just not in the mood. 
Point is, if she can't respect this boundary, what about others? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've waited until the strip was completely dry, but sometimes the way I put it on my nose made it become wrinkled in the process, and so I'd have
Parts of the strip with blackheads and others without.
Not helpful, but if anyone has a better way to apply it let me know!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on the person,like myself for example. I love animals, I was raised in a family that loved animals, so it's  also learned behavior, as well as personality. There are different things that mold our personalities, and different things that make us happy, aka trigger our 'pleasure centers.'
As humans, we enjoy company, and most of us are instinctually very nurturing. And animals give us unconditional love, no judgement.  it's a pretty awesome process out minds go through.
