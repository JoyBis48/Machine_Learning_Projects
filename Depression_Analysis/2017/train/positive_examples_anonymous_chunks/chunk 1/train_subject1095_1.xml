	<TEXT> Been over a year since I quit. Usually smoked 10g's Over 2-3 days, but had days where I would burn through a whole bag. Got pretty bad with it. I only smoked it out of a pipe so I would collect the ash/partially solid matter  and then shift it just enough to get the white ash off. Would basically smoke and resmoke until it just couldnt be lit anymore, strangely each hit was just as strong as a fresh bowl. Most days I would smoke until I pass out for like 15-30 minutes then toke up again repeating the process until lunch/dinner with the coma-naps getting longer as the day went on. I also woulx wake in the middle of the nightbjust for the sole purpose of getting another round in. Shit took its toll fast, mostly psychologically (sometimes voices but mostly just horrible paranoia/anxiety) but did notice chest pains and was constantly coughing shit up (tooks months of being off it to finally clear it up) I did pawn shit that was and wasn't mine to pawn just to get the next sack. Credit Cards were already pretty much maxed by the time I started using, but coincidentally my minimum payment was about as much as a sack was, so the cards stayed maxed out. 

My advice is to try to come to terms with the debt pile and slowly work it off. If you havent already, destroy the cards. You can always get new ones, but the wait for the replacements should help curb any craving or momentary loss of self-control. If you aren't completely ostrochised from your family, maybe have someone take control of your funds for a bit, the first couple months are always the hardest to resist the urge to re-up.

Invest in an e-cigarette. Doesn't even have to have nicotine in it. The act of blowing out smoke can help alleviate the urge to start smoking it again.

If your drug counselling is a group setting, try to be open to the others' stories and experiences. You might find some inspiration in their life experiences. 

They'll probably suggest this at counseling, but maybe look into a Narcotics Anonymous group. I never did do that, but it can definitly help with the healing process.

As for depression, that is a whole 'nother beast that I've struggled with my whole life. Hopefully yours is just due to temporary chemical imbalances and not hereditary. Either way /r/depression is a wounderful community at your disposal. 

Everything I said/suggested is purely from my own experience. Make sure you communicate with your doctors everything as they will know the best way to help you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   This whole debacle has potentially made that much more difficult here.

I think, if NZ is really going to have a rigorous screening process for the legal highs, then this will help with the education/protection for addicts regarding it all. I mean pretty much anyone can grow weed, but how many times have you heard of someone cooking up their own version of spice in their backyard? So as long as the new screening process isnt just a red herring that they hope people will forget about, then it will be more conducive to a healthier legal high culture.

Of course the perceived tolerance IME shoots up pretty high pretty fast with the synths so what you're saving just goes towards more of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FTA: "The New Zealand government's **testing regime**, expected to be **as rigorous as** that applied to **pharmaceutical drugs**, means that it could cost manufacturers of legal highs over $1 million NZD (£500,000) to have each product approved.

I'm sorry but I don't see the problem here. Is this not what we wanted? A stable product that isn't going to change its chemical make-up everytime a new law takes place? I don't pretend to know NZ politics, but I know as a former US spice user that I do wish I knew exactly what I was using and wish America did something along these lines instead of wave after wave of bans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man fuck this last year. Fuck it royally. Fuck the fact that I got promoted. Fuck the fact I kicked the several year long spice habit. Fuck the fact I got laid for the first and only time. Fuck it all. I still fucked up at school for the 3 or 4th time and am probably suspended from the system. . . again...I still drove her away with the creepiness and general beta-mindset. . ..still broke all the time cause I have poor money management skills...behind a couple months on my cards and will have student loans starting up again now that I'm out of school..
Fuck the fact old friends are back in town graduated and not responding to texts or calls. ..man fuckall this. At least I have my music.

Only people to remember it's my birthday is my ma, cousin, sister. Oh yea and the student loan company emailing me happy birthday trying to collect. But it's cool I get free movie tickets whenever I want. Oh and I get free stuff today at the smoke shop...

	<TEXT> As seen on Snoop Lion [here](http://i.imgur.com/v2OxaH7.jpg) 

I have always been a fan of that style headwear, but just never could find them.

First, what are they called?

Second, I'm not really looking for that color scheme per se, just one that'll work well on St. Patrick's Day.

Much Obliged.
