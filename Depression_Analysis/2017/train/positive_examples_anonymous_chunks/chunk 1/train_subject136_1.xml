I'm thinking I'd rather go into the store with a plan because I mostly buy clothes when I need them or when I see a really good sale.  What happens is I buy something but it doesn't really fit what I already own.  I want to gradually upgrade my wardrobe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My biggest weakness is putting it all together.  I'll buy a fine piece here or there but not know what I need to layer it with.  I'm starting to just look at the models on clothing websites and try to piece together a matching outfit.

I'm wondering if there is something out there that would allow me to place virtual clothing on an avatar or mannequin for every piece of clothing along with a bevy of options.  Something like what you see in the create a player mode in video games but focused on clothing only.


TL;DR:  I want to be able to piece together entire outfits in a virtual setting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree.  It's a major pain to cancel XM radio.  They lure you with that sweet deal hoping you forget.  Then when the deal runs out they try to do it again and again.

There's no way to cancel online and you HAVE to go through their phone system and reps to cancel.  It's like trying to dump someone who hasn't faced reality.

I know XM was more than happy to offer me the discounted rate three times until I finally stood firm.   </TEXT>

And someone retorted with this:


an occasional fap session is fine...  but i agree...daily? thats way too much... cats here go from one extreme to the next....  theres no middle ground... either you guys fap 10 times a day or you have to go 90 days fap-free....  moderation is the key to life...learn it.

HOA fees are around $120 a month.
I'm a senior engineer for a Fortune 100 company based in the midwest.  My job is as stable as it gets.

Anything else?  I'm more than willing to answer questions so I can make an informed decision.

Why do you guys hate townhouses?  I used to as well until I saw my coworker's setup and the low costs he was paying.  It makes sense for a young professional. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Considering buying a townhouse...  I need some help. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-18 15:29:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's my story.  I bought my first home about 3 years ago in GA with the First Time Homeowner's credit.  I had to move two years later and lost $20k on that home.  (Luckily I didn't have to pay the govt their $8K back)

Fast forward to now.  I've been renting a townhouse in my Iowa for about a year and a half.  My rent is $1050.  I can get similar and newer townhouse for $100K and a mortgage of $435.  The area seems stable and is actually being built up.

My questions... 

1.  Is there anything I'm not considering?  I don't want to get burnt again.
2.  Will the market ever pick up again?  I foolishly bought 3 years ago thinking rates couldnt get any lower.

I want a townhouse because I don't want to deal with the maintenance of a yard in this climate.  My thought process is worst case scenario I could always rent it and my company buys the house for market value if the ask me to move. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to look at all the other costs as well.  Is there an HOA?  what will your property taxes be?  Maintenance? upkeep?  etc.

The difference is only $75.  That's not that drastic. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This may help some of you out there.  I'm a 29 year old bachelor who makes enough money to buy whatever he wants.  But never buys what he needs.  Heres' a list of things I need that are inexpensive and would totally bring a smile to my face if I got them for Christmas.  

**Iron** -  I've been using the same cheap iron I had in college.  An upgrade to a decent one around $50 would be very useful.

**Vacuum** - Same as above.  A man is unlikely to buy himself a new vacuum.

**Nice Kitchenware (pots, knives, blender, etc)** - A nice pot here or there would be great.  When I need something I always go cheap.  Someone else springing $60 for that nice pot or a set of quality knives would be great.  I recently tried to make a cheesecake without a mixer and shredded cabbage without a food processor.  The experience was terrible.  I need new kitchenware bad!

**Logitech Harmony Remote** - I keep losing my remotes.  I need to consolidate.

**AA/AAA Batteries** -  Cheap.  But who's gonna turn down batteries?!?

**Dress Socks** - I can't explain it, but I always need some. 

Just some suggestions. </TEXT>
