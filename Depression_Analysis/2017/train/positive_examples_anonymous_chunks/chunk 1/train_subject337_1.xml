	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just drove home from an extremely exhausting weekend event. This was suppose to be a four hour drive, and it turned into nearly six and a half, with no stops and no traffic.

I get on the highway to go home, heading south. About 45 minutes in there is a junction and I can either take I-64 East or I-64 West. In my exhausted state, it somehow makes sense for me to go east. I'll note here that I live in southwest VA. So I'm driving along and I see a sign that tells me VA Beach is around 65 miles away or something like that. That should have been my first clue. But instead of wondering why I'm being told how far away VA Beach is when I'm suppose to be traveling away from it, I think "Oh cool I'm close to VA Beach, maybe I'll stop there!" And I keep driving. **For an hour.** Finally, I see a sign about the infamous bridge-tunnel, and that's when the red flags start going up in my head. I very slowly realized my mistake. It was not a good realization. I was already exhausted and just wanted to be home, and I'd just added two hours, at least, to my trip. Also wasted a quarter tank of gas. I angrily turned around and made my way home.

tl;dr Went the wrong direction on the highway, didn't realize for an hour. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually become suspicious of somewhen when I notice their reactions to things. I think a huge tell (and one that's really hard for me to fake) is the reaction to a bad situation. Example: my friend left my apt the other night, I immediately got into bed because I was exhausted. Friend knocks on door and says car has been towed. I'm just like "well that sucks. Goodnight". I assume normal people would want to help or something. I got called out on that. So if I see someone have a reaction like that when they should be more engaged, it throws a flag. Then I observe their other behavior and figure out if I think they are part of the 1% or if they just have trouble dealing with certain situations.

Also ITT: "let's argue about how many psychopaths we may or may not come in contact with." C'mon guys, we've been doing so well lately. The reality of it is this: the best guess that science can give is that 1% of the population suffers from some severity of ASPD. That's 1 in 100 people. In a typical day you will probably come into contact with more than 100 people, assuming you do things like go to lunch at a restaurant or work in a building with other people or walk around a college campus, etc. I think the more valid point is that you don't directly interact with over 100 people a day. So while the likelihood of you being in close proximity with a psychopath is not terribly low, the chances of you actually befriending one is slim. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all. New to the sub. I've never actually been involved in any migraine help community and I don't actually know anyone else who is afflicted.

I've been having weekly migraines since I was a teenager. I read a lot about going into a dark, quiet room and laying down, but that never seems to make a difference. I noticed a while back though that I seem to be temperature sensitive. During the migraine, I go through hot and cold changes. One minute I'll be burning up and having cold sweats and then the next I'll be shivering, like the cold is coming from the inside and no amount of sweatshirt or blanket can make me warm..

Also, laying down makes everything worse. I find that the pain is most manageable when I'm standing or walking around. I spend a lot of time pacing the floor.

Do these things happen to anyone else? Any opinions or tales from experience? Dunno if it's helpful or not, but I'm on sumatriptan 50mg. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-09-16 22:31:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's the background: for as long as I can remember (at least as young as 10 years old) my ears have felt clogged up. I try to yawn or move my jaw around or hold my nose while blowing to try and get them to pop, but they won't. Sometimes I have autophony. When I try to make them pop, I just hear some crackling, like they're trying to, but the pressure won't equalize. I can't go under 5-6 feet of water without it being excruciating because the pressure won't equalize. Oddly, I have zero problems with flying. It's extremely uncomfortable and I just want my ears to be normal. I've had hearing tests done and I have no loss of hearing. They've tested the pressure behind my eardrum and found it to be normal.

I've been to 4 ENTs. The first 2 told me I had allergies and told me to take daily Claritin and stay indoors. Tried daily allergy meds for a few months with no change. Staying indoors is not an option. I've never had allergy problems in my life, but I was willing to give anything a go. After that didn't work, ENT told me I would just have to live with it. Third ENT told me the same thing.

Fourth ENT was the first to actually try real solutions, and even though he couldn't fix me, I still thank him enormously for trying. He put me on two months of steroid nasal spray. When that did nothing, we decided to undergo the placement of tubes in my ears. I had that surgery three weeks ago. There is still no change. At my follow-up yesterday he has now told me there's nothing else to be done. He says sometimes the nerves send a signal of fullness to the brain so that it feels congested when it's really not. I can't accept this, because then the water depth wouldn't be an issue and I wouldn't get that crackling sound when I move my jaw around. Also, the autophony probably would not be an issue if it was just pesky nerves.

reddit, there must be something to be done. The congestion makes me want to stab holes in the side of my face as if that would help relieve it, and it feels like this all day, every day, for the past 15 years at least. I will answer any questions that may help solve this mystery.

Please help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use the two-finger trackpad gesture to go to the previous web page (quick for looking at pictures and such). Worked fine for the three weeks I've had this laptop. Installed RES 10 minutes ago and now it's not working. It causes Safari to freeze the current web page. The program itself works fine, other tabs that are open are not affected, but the tab that I'm in to try to swipe back freezes, regardless of if it is reddit or not. When it freezes, it moves maybe 10 pixels to the right, as if it's started to swipe back, and then sticks there and becomes unresponsive. I'm unable to open a new tab or navigate away from the current page. If it's the only tab open I have to restart Safari. I am able to close out of the affected tab.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My boss has tasked me with doing video editing, and seeing as I'm a programmer, I have zero clue about what I'm doing. I've watched enough YouTube tutorials to know how the software works, but now I'm getting into the content and I'm lost.

There is around 30 minutes of work-out video and I need to cut it down to a 30-ish second preview. There is only one camera angle, and it's relatively wide. I have no control over filming; I just get the finished videos handed to me from above.

There are over 20 series' I need to do this for. I'm using iMovie 10.0.3 on a MacBook Air.

What should I be looking to pull into a preview? Just playing around with the first series I managed 23 seconds, including a 4 second title. I just took a few seconds here and there showing different movements and with the trainer saying motivating or explanatory things, and crossfaded them together. Now I'm stuck on how to end it, and I really don't think the current 23 seconds that I have is any good. This is content that will be pushed to clients, so I need it to be at least halfway decent.

Everything I find by doing a Google search relates to movie editing and things with different camera angles and lots of dialogue and none of it is relevant. Any tips or advice is much needed and greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "“A lot of doctors and other mental health professionals just throw up their arms, and say, ‘What’s the point of even identifying antisocial personality disorder? What are we going to do with these people?’” said Donald W. Black, M.D., a professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine in Iowa City."

Not even the mental health professionals know what to do with us.

Also, that is the longest name of a university department college I have ever seen.

Is there any actual long-term benefit to doing this? I lack motivation to get into a runner's habit (working on that) and every now and then I get on a running kick. To put it in perspective, I use the Nike Run app and it tells me I've only run 11 miles so far this year. I tried to find some article to post, but no luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done some reading but have yet to find any good research done on the observed differences in how ASPD presents in each gender. I know it's much more prevalent in men, so most of what I can find online is from the male perspective. What differences, if any, have you noticed when working with ASPD patients of both genders? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been a few embedded discussions here recently relating to the difference between men and women with ASPD. I've been doing some reading in a few psych medical journals to try and find some concrete research on it, but the majority of the studies use prison inmates. I have found that the current statistics are estimated at there being 1 woman diagnosed for every 3 men.

Has anyone done any research you can share? Or what have you guys observed if you know any ASPD people of the opposite gender? I know we have at least one other active female member on here who I'd like to hear from.

Edit** More info

I posted this over in /r/psychotherapy as well, to see what the therapists and psychology professionals had to contribute. One person said he/she noticed that men usually acted alone, where women usually had an equally antisocial male counterpart. Found that interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ask because I went to VA Tech and today is the 7th anniversary of the shooting. I went to high school with the shooter and two of the girls who were killed, one of which I knew decently. Because of those things, I always have some semblance of an emotional response to this day, although I can't figure out what it is. Sadness maybe? Remnants of what that day was like? I don't know. My emotional palate is small. Regardless, it's a day I stay away from people because everyone is emotional and doing that whole "we're part of something greater" community thing and I can't stand it. Some people a few years ago wanted me to go to the candlelight vigil at midnight, so I did. I spent the whole time reading everyone else's faces. It was people-watching gold.

I also have the unpopular opinion that 33 Hokies died that day, because I include the shooter in the death count. I said this to one person, once, and will never make that mistake again.

But other shootings and violent acts/natural disasters, I don't feel anything for at all. Boston Marathon, Sandy Hook, hurricanes destroying cities, etc. I have that attitude of, "well, that happened" and I barely give it a second thought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a very small, old dog. I've found that I can just feed it and walk it and it doesn't require any attention other than that because he just lazes around the house all day. It's nice because he's barely there, so I haven't had an opportunity to really get bored with it, and he doesn't bother me. It's like having a moving piece of furniture that I have to buy food for.

It should be noted I suppose that I haven't had the desire to harm animals since I was young. People, yes, but I like animals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are happening naturally.

My first one was about a month ago. I was drifting off, and then my body felt like it was buzzing. It got so intense I could hardly stand it. I assume I entered the dream state at some point while the buzzing was going on because all at once the buzzing stopped and I was floating off of my bed, toward the ceiling. I know it wasn't an OBE because I looked down at the bed and my body wasn't there. I floated until I bumped into the ceiling. I was terrified and mustered all of my strength and screamed, which took me out of the dream. My roommate later told me that he'd heard me scream. I was so scared by what had happened that I couldn't sleep the rest of the night. Instead, I stayed up and researched as much as I could about lucid dreaming.

I was afraid to have another one through the following nights, but enough time passed that I stopped worrying about it, and I wrote it off as a one-time freak occurrence.

Until last night. I was drifting off and felt the buzzing again. Instead of being scared I tried to focus on it. Next I knew, I was floating around and out of my (closed) bedroom window. I dreamed I was exploring a little historical town. I was playing around with running and floating, and just controlling myself in general. The dream was so vivid. Normal dreams for me are blurry, or hazy, but this one was crystal clear, like I was really there on a bright sunny day. I could look around and go where I wanted. It was devoid of other people tho, or any action. It was just a little empty town, and me learning how to control my dream self.

I also noticed that I was aware of what my physical body was doing. I realized in the dream that I could float if I got a running start and kicked my legs, like swimming. I could feel my physical body moving my legs while I was doing that. Or if I turned my head to look at something, I knew my actual head was turning too. It almost felt like a part of me was caught between asleep and awake.

It lasted maybe ten minutes. I came out of it suddenly when I heard someone whisper "hey" in my ear and it sounded like it was whispered into my actual ear, and not my dream-self ear. (Note that I sleep alone.)

I'm very freaked out by the whole experience. I have done some research and looked through r/luciddreaming and noticed that a lot of you do this intentionally. Is it uncommon for it to happen naturally? Any advice as far as controlling it or dealing with it? Is my experience in line with a typical lucid dream? It's a frightening experience for me and any words of wisdom are appreciated.

tl;dr: Started having LD naturally. Freaked out. Help. </TEXT>

Can someone please offer some insight as to why the positioning is off and ways to correct the issue?

Open it in safari (if you have it) and chrome or firefox. In safari it looks like it should. The row of three pictures are horizontally inline with each other.
