I am glad you are okay after the riot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the major drop after the first episode might be because the server restart was just as hyped about as with UHCs. Everyone was excited for the new season and when it turned out they would be using a world border, there were more people than just those few Mindcrackers who disagreed with it. I guess they stopped watching immediately.

edit: whoops I don't know why I already submitted. Secondly, the server reset was during the holidays. On the one hand, no one is going to college so everyone has time to watch, but on the other hand, people are leaving town for multiple weeks, etcetera. I've been away for only a week, I went to Dublin, but I missed a week's content and I never managed to catch up. I felt like I should because I didn't wanna miss anything in that early stage of the new server, but I never did.. That might be the reason why I stopped watching (I only watch one when I'm really bored, I should definitely watch more often) and maybe this is the same for others..

And now people are back in college, having less time to watch. All I hope is that it's not the end of that server already. There are still people active but they upload a Mindcrack video each two days. I expect videos from at least Bdubs and Doc today, possibly Anderz and Vechs as well :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think tricking someone with someone else's wool is just smart. It makes people think about whether or not they should trust them, especially when that person just killed someone else. They should realize that they have multiple colors of wool on them, or they should first show a color or something like that. Or there should be some sort of a plugin that removes additional wool from someone's inventory, to prevent this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, of course a head would be better (as in cheaper) than 2 apples. I also understand it leads to a bit more PVP in order to obtain a head, which I don't think is really necessary, there's already enough PVP. Things don't have to go quicker. I'd rather see a team getting all geared up (iron/diamond armor, diamond sword, bow, maybe potions) than rushing into battle without being fully geared.

Maybe I wasn't clear enough. The heads are a good solution if you get low on health really quickly, like in a fight or just bad luck (like Sevadus this last season, lot of mobs around him), don't get me wrong there, but I don't think you really need it if you're well prepared or at almost full health. Which counts for almost everyone most of the time. Besides this, the golden apple works fine anyway. It's just the kill that adds another way of regenerating health, making it easier to do so. Especially near the end of a season, when there's more PVP and there's a few people left, wandering around with gear from a few other teams, it would only stretch out the last bits. They're all at full health again, very easily, and it's just "a normal PVP battle", nothing exciting to it because someone's not at full health anymore. I think it takes away a little bit of the challenge in UHC to regenerate health and to show the difference in skill. That's how I see it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually think that's too much.. That's almost half of your total health, would make it way too easy. I assume players would drop their heads? That means that with one apple, a bit of gold and a kill, you'd be able to get quite a lot of health back. I don't like it. It's also pointless to use one when you're not even four hearts down. That's how I see it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the Adventurer's backpack holds nothing by default until you change the forestry config file. ([Source](http://feed-the-beast.wikia.com/wiki/Adventurer's_Backpack)) But it might hold things you'd normally find in the world, like flowers, maybe types of wood/saplings? Don't really remember but I only used the Apiarist's backpack :P </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [ME3] Two questions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-24 10:08:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started Material Energy^3 a few days ago and I really like it. However, I have two questions.

1. I updated yesterday from 1.4.1 to 1.4.4. This update contained a lot of new quests, but I can't seem to complete them. For example the clay quest in the first chapter. I scanned the whole pond for clay, even dug under all the sand, dirt and gravel, but I couldn't find any more than 32 clay while I need 100. Also, the next quest says there's some sort of AE room under the clay. This was all dirt and stuff for me. Is there a way to "update" the spatial areas so I can complete the quests instead of /hqm edit them? I just finished the first chapter of the quest book before I updated so I'm not that far ahead in the game. If it's necessary, a restart wouldn't be a big problem, but I'd prefer not to.

2. This question is somewhat stupid maybe, but I feel like I'm missing a lot of loot and Easter Eggs on this map. Am I supposed to literally investigate every single area? Break through walls and floors etcetera? I accidentally broke a few blocks yesterday and there was a chest, so I guess there's a lot more of these chests hidden around each spatial area.. Am I supposed to just tear everything apart? Or is there a logical way to reach these chests? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started a vanilla server a few weeks ago and I'm having a lot of fun with it, even though I've played modded minecraft for most of the time. It's funny how you can fill your whole minecraft day with harvesting all your crops or shear all your sheep. However I am looking for some fun or odd goals to complete. For example, obtain a stack of poisonous potatoes. I have 7 already :D Anyone have more of these fun goals to do besides the things I'm already working on? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Suggestions for an adventure-based modpack </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-20 17:56:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Me and some friends are starting a new server soon and like previous times, we wanna build a custom modpack. This time we're less focused on tech mods and more focused on magic mods like Thaumcraft, Blood Magic, Ars Magica and Witchery. We're also looking for a bit of a challenge, or rather adventure, so we'll probably add some dungeon mods and a few mods that add more (difficulty to) mobs.

Our question now is if anyone knows of any mods that are more tier-based. Most of the tech mods around these days make Minecraft a lot easier and once you've set up a few machines, you're already good to go. We don't want this anymore.

Also, we're looking for a mod that adds maybe a few food items. Not as much as Pam's Harvestcraft. Does anyone have any suggestions for this?


Edit: I forgot to mention we're trying to build a 1.7.10 modpack

Thanks a bunch. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 1.7.10 seed: great survival island + 2 ocean temples nearby! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-25 20:29:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seed: 2735126617611667291

You spawn on [an island](http://gyazo.com/e96824ac3f3a3576edc18927d2da12dd) with a small patch of grass. In the distance (I have render distance at maximum though) you see [another island](http://gyazo.com/7a036c84ae96b9a6288709bf4d7bebef) with a few oak trees on it. It's just over 200 blocks to the south. Furthermore, there are two ocean temples nearby. One is close to the spawn island at X -300, Z +170. The other is close to the second island at X -470 and Z +615.

I think this can serve as a great survival map. You start with some trees and your island. You can cave down (be careful with the water) and you might spot more bits of land on your way. I have not seen a single bit of continent, only very small islands. There might also be more ocean dungeons, I don't know. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [AS] Lost all TC4 research points after updating from 2.1.9 to 3.0.1 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-18 11:14:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Title says it all. Research table is empty but I can't scan items to get my research points back because my Thaumometer says I already scanned it! I had a lot of aspects for all of them. I went crazy scanning everything on my items, even everything in my chests and ME network. I don't have anything to scan for new research points.

I am telling this because I'm curious if I'm the only one, and if someone knows what could have caused this to happen. Thaumcraft is not updated between AS 2.1.9 and AS 3.0.1. For now I gave myself 400 of each primal aspect but if this happens to more people, I think someone should look into it. I have never seen this before. I know I can go and find tons of nodes for a good amount of primal aspects and combine my way back up again, but that's not what I want. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [AS] Steady supply of sulfur? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-17 10:37:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have no idea how I can get myself some sulfur very easily. I know there's a Nether ore but I have no intentions to enter the Nether at all. I don't have the resources and power to set up the laser drill (planning to do so, gonna set up an animal farm with a slaughterhouse anywhere these days) so yeah, no Nether ores for me now. I've been pulverizing a lot of coal which has a 10% chance of sulfur but I'm getting low on coal and I got pulverized coal everywhere.

Is it worth it to set up a blaze farm in the meantime and then pulverize some of the blaze rods every now and then? I really need the sulfur for yellorium dust for my big reactor. I managed to get enough stuff to finish the reactor but I can barely fill it with yellorium... As soon as I can, I'm also one step closer to the laser drill. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [AS] Question on MFR farm with Pam's soy beans </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-02 15:52:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I am playing the Ag Skies map like many of us and I set up my MFR soy bean farm yesterday. It's quite big because I can replace a lot of ingredients in the Hell's Kitchen quests with tofu or soy milk etcetera. Just wanna keep this running.

I've run into one minor problem though. Or not even a problem, but it's getting annoying. The farm is 100% soy beans but every now and then there are asparagus seeds lying around on the floor around the farm. It's free asparagus seeds, but where are they coming from? Does it have something to do with the ore dictionary? It's only asparagus seeds, very strange... </TEXT>
