	<TEXT> This guy walks in, sits down at the end of the bar and orders a stiff drink. 

Bartender comes back a little bit later and since its a pretty slow night, he decides to chit-chat with the customer. After a little bit the bartender asks the man what he does for a living. 

Customer says, "I'm a Center for the Dallas Cowboys."

Bartender replies, "Man, it must be really tough having to do that."

"Its not too bad. I enjoy it" 

"No, I meant being openly gay in Texas." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know its a bit out of context for a lot of us, however I've been mostly free for a bit now, though I feel lie I'm starting to fall into depression again. (Bi-polar II / manic depressive since I was a kid.) 

Back story; Met a lovely lady a year (around abouts) ago at a mutual friend's birthday party. Nice woman, perhaps a bit drunk, talked a while, facebook friends later. 

Get to talking, she's pretty cool, works in graphic design, responds positively to advances, sexual exchanges including suggestive photographs even though she's in a relationship (I knew) plus she's 13 years older (I'm mature, she's immature). 

We continue talking, life, love, sex all that, advances that she reciprocates to the extent of still being with someone. (Nothing ever happened though it very well could have. Yes, I know. Cheats with you, cheats on you.)

Around her birthday, her BF dumps her, kicks her out, for reasons that she either didn't tell me or he never told her. After a while she agrees to go to lunch with me and then the next week come over and let me make her dinner and watch a movie with drinks. 

Week later, she has to skip dinner because she said she found out he cheated on her and was feeling sick as a result, then tells me later that week she has started seeing someone and that she is confused why I would be upset about this as she told me she couldn't date someone who worked at a bar or who was younger. 

I didn't take this as she thought I would, and that she thought she made that clear before. Back and forth for a few weeks, things said in anger and with inhibition on both sides. 

Anyway, I get past that, ask her how its going, blah blah blah, ask her about her drinking. 

She says she stopped a few weeks ago. (lightbulb) I say good that she stopped drinking so much as it elt like half the times I talked to her she had been. 

And of course, it appears she was. 

Fucking of course, clearly no one could be interested in me unless they were drunk half the time. I don't even know why I try. 

This is more of a rant about the slide of someone with the history of depression than the life of, But, IDFC shit happens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was diagnosed when I was 11. Every step I have taken since has tightened the noose around my neck. High School was easy, living with the possibility of escape in alcohol is difficult. I'm 27. I work as a bouncer in a club. I might be good at it, but the discount on drinks is worth even more. I work 3 nights a week, and the nights I'm off, I spend $40-80 on cheap whiskey. 

Ever wonder what life is like when you have barriers no one will break?

I like to call it The Slide. You know its happening, you know why, but there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.

Do you know what its like to ask for help and the only response you get is silence? Ever wonder what life is like when you ask yourself if you have to kill someone to fucking notice? 

I don't want to die, but what reason do I have to live? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For artists in design, web and general media.

Something the size of a pen that could detect what color something is. You'd put it up to the color you want to 'collect' and you could store like 500 or so colors. Then you could hook it up to a computer and you would see all the different colors you caught and the hex code and the Pantone or other companies info on the color. 

There would be different levels of product- RGB or CMYK; 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 captures; how nice the pen looks (like a nice fountain pen); bluetooth connectivity to your tablet or phone so you can check the color if you'd like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been working on a campaign for a local candidate and I needed to find a way to describe him in a tagline. So I was thinking about it all day Friday and off and on the week prior, and just chilled all weekend. So this morning, I woke up had some breakfast, went outside for my coffee and a smoke and as I'm finishing both, BOOM. 

It's perfect. Simple, progressive, clear, and wraps him in a neat little envelope. 

FUCK YEAH. </TEXT>
