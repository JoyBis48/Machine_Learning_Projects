	<TEXT> Personally, I love just a little bit of shyness.

Oh my God, it's so adorable, and I don't even mean 'adorable' in a patronising sense, just plain attractive. I'm a shy person myself so maybe I just would prefer that to someone who is mega outgoing, which would be way too much for me to be around. 

So, yeah, quiet/shy/introverted/introspective, that general family of traits... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I've seen how controversial they appear to be with the fanbase and I must admit that I haven't found Paul of Dune to be anywhere near as enjoyable as Dune or the cheeky few chapters of other FH books in the Dune series I've glanced over in the past. 

In Paul of Dune it just feels like I'm getting whisked through an assembly line of events that feel kind of flat. Were it not for the fact that I feel like maybe I'm learning a few more details about the Dune universe and getting a few bits and pieces reinforced for me I don't think I'd be as keen to read through it.

Thanks for your input, guys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Coolio, I may as well carry on and finish Paul of Dune and then I'll see about finding copies of the other books after I've read Messiah :D Thanks. 

Out of interest though, do you recommend reading them this way because it provides a better narrative or more due to the (presumably superior) quality of the Frank Herbert books over the others? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So after having read Dune for the first time some months ago I was kindly given a few of the sequels for Christmas (Paul of Dune, Dune Messiah, and Winds of Dune) by someone who isn't a fan of the books themselves but knew I liked the Dune franchise and that I wanted to read more. They say they got the suggested reading order (as I listed them) from snooping around online, but of course, given the many different ways there are of reading through the series, I'd imagine it's pretty open to interpretation.


I started Paul of Dune a few days ago and am now most of the way through it and appreciate that it reads completely differently to Frank's style (if I'm honest I'm not sure I enjoy it so much though, personally). My question is, as a newbie, is this the best way to go about reading the books? Should I have just read the original books first and gone back to fill in the gaps with the Brian/Kevin Anderson installments later on? Or should I plow on with my current trajectory (chronological from Dune onwards). Or some entirely other order? I'm very open to suggestions and advice at this point and would be grateful for your input :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently got around to watching it for the first time too. I have to say I absolutely love the aesthetics of it; I feel David Lynch really did bring something to it in that regard. The whole look and tone of it felt 'right' to me and only added to how I'd personally pictured things from the book. Different and separate from how I experience the books, but I like it well enough.

Beyond that though...yeah, "meh"..."meh" all the way, especially with all that inner dialogue. I've no doubt that a good film adaptation could somehow manage to capture all the introspection of the books but this one didn't quite.

I feel that I'll always be fond of it as an adaptation, though.

	<TEXT> Yeah, I find moving about and interacting with the world helps, especially if it comes on when I'm just lying in bed at night looking out at my room. What's most annoying is that I can easily 'switch' to viewing the world like that at will and used to do it all the time when I was little, (especially during long school assemblies, making the speaker's head look tiny, like you did with your friend). For some reason it didn't bother me. Now, I feel like younger me maybe made it somehow more likely to happen out of habit or whatever, gah... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Monocular cues (cues to depth relying on only one eye) such as the ones listed in the other comments (movement, object size, texture gradient, occlusion, relative movement of your single eye etc...), are one part of the story. However the reason the world doesn't suddenly appear flat when you close one eye is also partly because you have gone through your entire life (from a certain young age at any rate) seeing the world in 3-D. Eyesight depends on your eyes but vision happens in the brain, the world is actively constructed for you by the information coming in through your eyes and even if one eye is shut it 'knows' that the world is still one of depth. This is why, even though people with one eye, or eyes that are unable to coordinate together (most commonly, for example, people with untreated childhood strabismus), can use the monocular cues to navigate the world in three dimensional space, *but they lack that subjective feeling of 'depth' and 'space' that comes with stereoscopic vision*. One famous example of someone who trained themselves to coordinate both eyes to see in depth after a lifetime of seeing the world in 2-D is Susan Barry, or 'Stereo Sue'. In her talks and book (which I recommend to anyone interested in the psychology of visual perception) she details the subjective, qualitative differences between seeing the world in monovision and stereovision. Hope that helps :)
